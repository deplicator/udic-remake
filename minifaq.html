<H3><A NAME="whatis">What is the UDIC?</A> </H3>

<P>UDIC stands for Ultima Dragons Internet Chapter. Its a social
club on the Internet whose members share a common interest: the
Ultima series of games by <A
HREF="http://www.origin.ea.com/english/">Origin Systems, Inc</A>.
The club has more than 9,000 members throughout the world.
Members chat, share Ultima clues, and generally have fun.</P>

<P>The Ultima Dragons were originally created on February 27,
1992 on Prodigy. They were disbanded in early 1994, but were
reestablished on the Internet later that year as the Ultima
Dragons Internet Chapter. Since the Prodigy Ultima Dragons club
no longer exists, Ultima Dragons can be used to refer to the
UDIC. </P>

<H3><A NAME="joinudic">How to join the UDIC:</A> </H3>

<P>If you can, fill out the WWW form. Its at: &lt;<A
HREF="join.html">http://www.udic.org/join.html</A>&gt; It'll ask
all the right questions and make sure its delivered to the proper
place. </P>

<P>If you can't access the WWW directly but you can telnet, then
telnet to <A HREF="telnet://info.funet.fi">info.funet.fi</A> and
log in as www. You can use that to access the above URL. </P>

<P>If you can't do any of this but you can send email then send
email to <A HREF="mailto:join@udic.org">join@udic.org</A>.
Include your chosen dragon name (__ Dragon) your email address,
your real name, which ultimas you've played and anything else you
feel like sending.</P>

<P>Where does this actually get delivered? A team of ten to
twenty club members (the Greeting team) receives and analyzes
your application, and stores it in the <A HREF="members/">online
membership roster</A>. </P>

<P>The only entrance requirement is that you must have played at
least one Ultima game. Thats one of the reasons why any dragon
can let you in to the club. But, to make it on to the roster you
need to do one of the two things above. </P>

<H3><A NAME="prodigy">For members of the Ultima Dragons on
Prodigy:</A> </H3>

<P>Also, for any of you out there who were members of the Prodigy
club before it disbanded, a few quick notes: </P>

<P>1) Welcome back, we're glad to have you. </P>

<P>2) Please follow the <A HREF="#joinudic">above instructions</A>
for joining the club so that you will be on the roster. </P>

<P>3) To denote membership in the club, we put a -==(UDIC)==- in
our .signature files (so that they're included at the end of our
posts). There are no other ranks, offices or government in this
club. Most dragons are against creating any sort of government
and posting your old prodigy rank as anything other than a joke
is the closest thing we have to a faux pas. </P>

<P>4) The newsgroup (<A
HREF="news:rec.games.computer.ultima-dragons">rec.games.computer.ultima-dragons</A>)
is on the usenet. So, we more or less follow the usenet
nettiquette conventions, NOT Prodigy's posting conventions. If
you're new to the internet and the usenet then I <STRONG>strongly
reccomend</STRONG> you <A HREF="usenet.html">read the nettiquette
FAQ</A> on the newsgroup <A HREF="news:news.announce.newusers">news.announce.newusers</A>
<EM>before you post</EM>. If you're an old hand on the usenet
then read the nettiquette FAQ anyway: It can't hurt to refresh
your memory. </P>

<P>5) There are no official leaders in the club. If you want to
know who fills the rolls (the 'defacto' leaders) then read the
newsgroup for a couple weeks. If you want to be a leader, then be
active in the club and find a niche to fill (or a filled niche
that isn't being done well enough). Like the shoe commercial
says, Just do it. </P>

<P>6) This club was created Fall '94 by <A
HREF="mailto:sbrindle@netcom.com">Ethereal Dragon</A>, one of the
members from the Prodigy club. A number of the folks in the club
were also in the old one. If you're looking for someone, check
the roster and failing that, feel free to ask. </P>

<P>7) Once again, welcome back. :) </P>
