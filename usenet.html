<h1 align="center">A Primer on How to Work With the Usenet
Community </h1>

<p align="center">Chuq Von Rospach </p>

<p>*** This message describes the Usenet culture and customs that
have developed over time. Other documents in this newsgroup
describe what Usenet is and manuals or on-line help on your
system should provide detailed technical documentation. All new
users should read this message to acclimate themselves to Usenet.
(Old users could read it, too, to refresh their memories.) *** </p>

<p>It is the people participating in Usenet that make it worth
the effort to read and maintain; for Usenet to function properly
those people must be able to interact in productive ways. This
document is intended as a guide to using the net in ways that
will be pleasant and productive for everyone. </p>

<p>This document is not intended to teach you how to use Usenet.
Instead, it is a guide to using it politely, effectively and
efficiently. Communication by computer is new to almost
everybody, and there are certain aspects that can make it a
frustrating experience until you get used to them. This document
should help you avoid the worst traps. </p>

<p>The easiest way to learn how to use Usenet is to watch how
others use it. Start reading the news and try to figure out what
people are doing and why. After a couple of weeks you will start
understanding why certain things are done and what things
shouldn't be done. There are documents available describing the
technical details of how to use the software. These are different
depending on which programs you use to access the news. You can
get copies of these from your system administrator. If you do not
know who that person is, they can be contacted on most systems by
mailing to account &quot;news&quot;, &quot;usenet&quot; or
&quot;postmaster&quot;. </p>

<p><strong>Never Forget that the Person on the Other Side is
Human. </strong></p>

<p>Because your interaction with the network is through a
computer it is easy to forget that there are people &quot;out
there.&quot; Situations arise where emotions erupt into a verbal
free-for-all that can lead to hurt feelings. </p>

<p>Please remember that people all over the world are reading
your words. Do not attack people if you cannot persuade them with
your presentation of the facts. Screaming, cursing, and abusing
others only serves to make people think less of you and less
willing to help you when you need it. </p>

<p>If you are upset at something or someone, wait until you have
had a chance to calm down and think about it. A cup of (decaf!)
coffee or a good night's sleep works wonders on your perspective.
Hasty words create more problems than they solve. Try not to say
anything to others you would not say to them in person in a room
full of people. </p>

<p><strong>Don't Blame System Admins for their Users' Behavior.</strong>
</p>

<p>Sometimes, you may find it necessary to write to a system
administrator about something concerning his or her site. Maybe
it is a case of the software not working, or a control message
escaped, or maybe one of the users at that site has done
something you feel requires comment. No matter how steamed you
may be, be polite to the sysadmin -- he or she may not have any
idea of what you are going to say, and may not have any part in
the incidents involved. By being civil and temperate, you are
more likely to obtain their courteous attention and assistance. </p>

<p><strong>Never assume that a person is speaking for their
organization. </strong></p>

<p>Many people who post to Usenet do so from machines at their
office or school. Despite that, never assume that the person is
speaking for the organization that they are posting their
articles from (unless the person explicitly says so). Some people
put explicit disclaimers to this effect in their messages, but
this is a good general rule. If you find an article offensive,
consider taking it up with the person directly, or ignoring it.
Learn about &quot;kill files&quot; in your newsreader, and other
techniques for ignoring people whose postings you find offensive.
</p>

<p><strong>Be Careful What You Say About Others.</strong> </p>

<p>Please remember -- you read netnews; so do as many as
3,000,000 other people. This group quite possibly includes your
boss, your friend's boss, your girl friend's brother's best
friend and one of your father's beer buddies. Information posted
on the net can come back to haunt you or the person you are
talking about. </p>

<p>Think twice before you post personal information about
yourself or others. This applies especially strongly to groups
like soc.singles and alt.sex but even postings in groups like
talk.politics.misc have included information about the personal
life of third parties that could get them into serious trouble if
it got into the wrong hands. </p>

<p><strong>Be Brief.</strong> </p>

<p>Never say in ten words what you can say in fewer. Say it
succinctly and it will have a greater impact. Remember that the
longer you make your article, the fewer people will bother to
read it. </p>

<p><strong>Your Postings Reflect Upon You -- Be Proud of Them. </strong></p>

<p>Most people on Usenet will know you only by what you say and
how well you say it. They may someday be your co-workers or
friends. Take some time to make sure each posting is something
that will not embarrass you later. </p>

<p>Minimize your spelling errors and make sure that the article
is easy to read and understand. Writing is an art and to do it
well requires practice. Since much of how people judge you on the
net is based on your writing, such time is well spent. </p>

<p><strong>Use Descriptive Titles. </strong></p>

<p>The subject line of an article is there to enable a person
with a limited amount of time to decide whether or not to read
your article. Tell people what the article is about before they
read it. A title like &quot;Car for Sale&quot; to rec.autos does
not help as much as &quot;66 MG Midget for sale: Beaverton
OR.&quot; Don't expect people to read your article to find out
what it is about because many of them won't bother. Some sites
truncate the length of the subject line to 40 characters so keep
your subjects short and to the point. </p>

<p><strong>Think About Your Audience. </strong></p>

<p>When you post an article, think about the people you are
trying to reach. Asking UNIX(*) questions on rec.autos will not
reach as many of the people you want to reach as if you asked
them on comp.unix.questions or comp.unix.internals. Try to get
the most appropriate audience for your message, not the widest. </p>

<p>It is considered bad form to post both to misc.misc,
soc.net-people, or misc.wanted and to some other newsgroup. If it
belongs in that other newsgroup, it does not belong in misc.misc,
soc.net-people, or misc.wanted. </p>

<p>If your message is of interest to a limited geographic area
(apartments, car sales, meetings, concerts, etc...), restrict the
distribution of the message to your local area. Some areas have
special newsgroups with geographical limitations, and the recent
versions of the news software allow you to limit the distribution
of material sent to world-wide newsgroups. Check with your system
administrator to see what newsgroups are available and how to use
them. </p>

<p>If you want to try a test of something, do not use a
world-wide newsgroup! Messages in misc.misc that say &quot;This
is a test&quot; are likely to cause large numbers of caustic
messages to flow into your mailbox. There are newsgroups that are
local to your computer or area that should be used. Your system
administrator can tell you what they are. </p>

<p>Be familiar with the group you are posting to before you post!
You shouldn't post to groups you do not read, or post to groups
you've only read a few articles from -- you may not be familiar
with the on-going conventions and themes of the group. One
normally does not join a conversation by just walking up and
talking. Instead, you listen first and then join in if you have
something pertinent to contribute. </p>

<p><strong>Be Careful with Humor and Sarcasm.</strong> </p>

<p>Without the voice inflections and body language of personal
communications, it is easy for a remark meant to be funny to be
misinterpreted. Subtle humor tends to get lost, so take steps to
make sure that people realize you are trying to be funny. The net
has developed a symbol called the smiley face. It looks like
&quot;:-)&quot; and points out sections of articles with humorous
intent. No matter how broad the humor or satire, it is safer to
remind people that you are being funny. But also be aware that
quite frequently satire is posted without any explicit
indications. If an article outrages you strongly, you should ask
yourself if it just may have been unmarked satire. Several
self-proclaimed connoisseurs refuse to use smiley faces, so take
heed or you may make a temporary fool of yourself. </p>

<p><strong>Only Post a Message Once.</strong> </p>

<p>Avoid posting messages to more than one newsgroup unless you
are sure it is appropriate. If you do post to multiple
newsgroups, do not post to each group separately. Instead,
specify all the groups on a single copy of the message. This
reduces network overhead and lets people who subscribe to more
than one of those groups see the message once instead of having
to wade through each copy. </p>

<p><strong>Please Rotate Messages With Questionable Content.</strong>
</p>

<p>Certain newsgroups (such as rec.humor) have messages in them
that may be offensive to some people. To make sure that these
messages are not read unless they are explicitly requested, these
messages should be encrypted. The standard encryption method is
to rotate each letter by thirteen characters so that an
&quot;a&quot; becomes an &quot;n&quot;. This is known on the
network as &quot;rot13&quot; and when you rotate a message the
word &quot;rot13&quot; should be in the &quot;Subject:&quot;
line. Most of the software used to read Usenet articles have some
way of encrypting and decrypting messages. Your system
administrator can tell you how the software on your system works,
or you can use the Unix command </p>

<p><samp>tr '[a-m][n-z][A-M][N-Z]' '[n-z][a-m][N-Z][A-M]'</samp> </p>

<p>Don't forget the single quotes!) </p>

<p><strong>Summarize What You are Following Up.</strong> </p>

<p>When you are following up someone's article, please summarize
the parts of the article to which you are responding. This allows
readers to appreciate your comments rather than trying to
remember what the original article said. It is also possible for
your response to get to some sites before the original article. </p>

<p>Summarization is best done by including appropriate quotes
from the original article. Do not include the entire article
since it will irritate the people who have already seen it. Even
if you are responding to the entire article, summarize only the
major points you are discussing. </p>

<p><strong>When Summarizing, Summarize!</strong> </p>

<p>When you request information from the network, it is common
courtesy to report your findings so that others can benefit as
well. The best way of doing this is to take all the responses
that you received and edit them into a single article that is
posted to the places where you originally posted your question.
Take the time to strip headers, combine duplicate information,
and write a short summary. Try to credit the information to the
people that sent it to you, where possible. </p>

<p><strong>Use Mail, Don't Post a Follow-up.</strong> </p>

<p>One of the biggest problems we have on the network is that
when someone asks a question, many people send out identical
answers. When this happens, dozens of identical answers pour
through the net. Mail your answer to the person and suggest that
they summarize to the network. This way the net will only see a
single copy of the answers, no matter how many people answer the
question. </p>

<p>If you post a question, please remind people to send you the
answers by mail and at least offer to summarize them to the
network. </p>

<p><strong>Read All Follow-ups and Don't Repeat What Has Already
Been Said.</strong> </p>

<p>Before you submit a follow-up to a message, read the rest of
the messages in the newsgroup to see whether someone has already
said what you want to say. If someone has, don't repeat it. </p>

<p><strong>Check the Headers When Following Up.</strong> </p>

<p>The news software has provisions to specify that follow-ups to
an article should go to a specific set of newsgroups -- possibly
different from the newsgroups to which the original article was
posted. Sometimes the groups chosen for follow-ups are totally
inappropriate, especially as a thread of discussion changes with
repeated postings. You should carefully check the groups and
distributions given in the header and edit them as appropriate.
If you change the groups named in the header, or if you direct
follow-ups to a particular group, say so in the body of the
message -- not everyone reads the headers of postings. </p>

<p><strong>Be Careful About Copyrights and Licenses.</strong> </p>

<p>Once something is posted onto the network, it is *probably* in
the public domain unless you own the appropriate rights (most
notably, if you wrote the thing yourself) and you post it with a
valid copyright notice; a court would have to decide the
specifics and there are arguments for both sides of the issue.
Now that the US has ratified the Berne convention, the issue is
even murkier (if you are a poster in the US). For all practical
purposes, though, assume that you effectively give up the
copyright if you don't put in a notice. Of course, the
*information* becomes public, so you mustn't post trade secrets
that way. </p>

<p>When posting material to the network, keep in mind that
material that is UNIX-related may be restricted by the license
you or your company signed with AT&amp;T and be careful not to
violate it. You should also be aware that posting movie reviews,
song lyrics, or anything else published under a copyright could
cause you, your company, or members of the net community to be
held liable for damages, so we highly recommend caution in using
this material. </p>

<p><strong>Cite Appropriate References.</strong> </p>

<p>If you are using facts to support a cause, state where they
came from. Don't take someone else's ideas and use them as your
own. You don't want someone pretending that your ideas are
theirs; show them the same respect. </p>

<p><strong>Mark or Rotate Answers and Spoilers.</strong> </p>

<p>When you post something (like a movie review that discusses a
detail of the plot) which might spoil a surprise for other
people, please mark your message with a warning so that they can
skip the message. Another alternative would be to use the
&quot;rot13&quot; protocol to encrypt the message so it cannot be
read accidentally. When you post a message with a spoiler in it
make sure the word &quot;spoiler&quot; is part of the
&quot;Subject:&quot; line. </p>

<p><strong>Spelling Flames Considered Harmful.</strong> </p>

<p>Every few months a plague descends on Usenet called the
spelling flame. It starts out when someone posts an article
correcting the spelling or grammar in some article. The immediate
result seems to be for everyone on the net to turn into a 6th
grade English teacher and pick apart each other's postings for a
few weeks. This is not productive and tends to cause people who
used to be friends to get angry with each other. </p>

<p>It is important to remember that we all make mistakes, and
that there are many users on the net who use English as a second
language. There are also a number of people who suffer from
dyslexia and who have difficulty noticing their spelling
mistakes. If you feel that you must make a comment on the quality
of a posting, please do so by mail, not on the network. </p>

<p><strong>Don't Overdo Signatures.</strong> </p>

<p>Signatures are nice, and many people can have a signature
added to their postings automatically by placing it in a file
called &quot;$HOME/.signature&quot;. Don't overdo it. Signatures
can tell the world something about you, but keep them short. A
signature that is longer than the message itself is considered to
be in bad taste. The main purpose of a signature is to help
people locate you, not to tell your life story. Every signature
should include at least your return address relative to a major,
known site on the network and a proper domain-format address.
Your system administrator can give this to you. Some news posters
attempt to enforce a 4 line limit on signature files -- an amount
that should be more than sufficient to provide a return address
and attribution. </p>

<p><strong>Limit Line Length and Avoid Control Characters.</strong>
</p>

<p>Try to keep your text in a generic format. Many (if not most)
of the people reading Usenet do so from 80 column terminals or
from workstations with 80 column terminal windows. Try to keep
your lines of text to less than 80 characters for optimal
readability. If people quote part of your article in a followup,
short lines will probably show up better, too. </p>

<p>Also realize that there are many, many different forms of
terminals in use. If you enter special control characters in your
message, it may result in your message being unreadable on some
terminal types; a character sequence that causes reverse video on
your screen may result in a keyboard lock and graphics mode on
someone else's terminal. You should also try to avoid the use of
tabs, too, since they may also be interpreted differently on
terminals other than your own. </p>

<p><strong>Please do not use Usenet as a resource for homework
assignments. </strong></p>

<p>Usenet is not a resource for homework or class assignments. A
common new user reaction to learning of all these people out
there holding discussions is to view them as a great resource for
gathering information for reports and papers. Trouble is, after
seeing a few hundred such requests, most people get tired of
them, and won't reply anyway. Certainly not in the expected or
hoped-for numbers. Posting student questionnaires automatically
brands you a &quot;newbie&quot; and does not usually garner much
more than a tiny number of replies. Further, some of those
replies are likely to be incorrect. </p>

<p>Instead, read the group of interest for a while, and find out
what the main &quot;threads&quot; are - what are people
discussing? Are there any themes you can discover? Are there
different schools of thought? Only post something after you've
followed the group for a few weeks, after you have read the
Frequently Asked Questions posting if the group has one, and if
you still have a question or opinion that others will probably
find interesting. If you have something interesting to
contribute, you'll find that you gain almost instant acceptance,
and your posting will generate a large number of follow-up
postings. Use these in your research; it is a far more efficient
(and accepted) way to learn about the group than to follow that
first instinct and post a simple questionnaire. </p>

<p><strong>Please do not use Usenet as an advertising medium.</strong>
</p>

<p>Advertisements on Usenet are rarely appreciated. In general,
the louder or more inappropriate the ad is, the more antagonism
it will stir up. The accompanying posting &quot;Rules for posting
to Usenet&quot; has more on this in the section about
&quot;Announcement of professional products or services&quot;.
Try the biz.* hierarchies instead. </p>

<p><strong>Avoid posting to multiple newsgroups.</strong> </p>

<p>Few things annoy Usenet readers as much as multiple copies of
a posting appearing in multiple newsgroups. (called 'spamming'
for historical reasons) A posting that is cross-posted (i.e lists
multiple newsgroups on the Newsgroups: header line) to a few
appropriate newsgroups is fine, but even with cross-posts,
restraint is advised. For a cross-post, you may want to set the
Followup-To: header line to the most suitable group for the rest
of the discussion. </p>
