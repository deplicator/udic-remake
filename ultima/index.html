<h1>The Ultima &amp; UDIC Archive has moved!</h1>


<P>It would appear that you have used the old URL. The correct way to access 
the Ultima WWW Info Page is is with URLs which begin with
"<a href="http://www.owo.com/archive/"
>http://www.owo.com/archive/</a>".</p>

<P>Unfortunately, you have tried to use some other URL. If you saved this
other URL as a bookmark then you should probably change it. If you got here
via a link from someone's home page then please let them know about their 
mistake.</P>

<P>I have analysed the information provided by your World Wide Web browser. 
You probably should have used the URL
"<a href="http://www.owo.com/archive/">http://www.owo.com/archive/</a>".</P>

<P>If you are using Netscape, you will automatically forward to the correct
page in 10 seconds.</P>
