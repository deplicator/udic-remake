*Note:* This is an older version of the FAQ; the new one has not
yet been converted to HTML. You can find an ASCII text version of
the new one at <a
href="http://wou.udic.org/~redjr/files/faq5.01.txt">http://wou.udic.org/~redjr/files/faq5.01.txt</a>.</p>

<p>This FAQ contains information about the Ultima Dragons -
Internet Chapter, an on-line club for and about Origin's Ultima
series of computer role playing game. It also contains
information about the alt.games.ultima.dragons newsgroup, as well
as sources of Ultima-related information that can be found on the
Internet. Technically, this FAQ is a guide and handbook for
members of the Ultima Dragons, as well as a guide to netiquette
on the alt.games.ultima.dragons newsgroup. There is no section of
actual questions and answers for the games themselves, as this
document was not designed to provide actual help on the Ultima
games except in a most general way. Besides, answering specific
questions about the games in this FAQ would more or less defeat
the purpose of the Ultima Dragons. Therefore, a fair proportion
of the questions are most likely devoted to answering queries
about the Ultima Dragons' purpose, history, and the like, as well
as that of the newsgroup. </p>

<p>This FAQ was written by Barry Ramirez (Monomolecular Dragon)
and edited by William Herrin (<a
href="http://www.dirtside.com/herrin/">Fallible Dragon</a>) and is
posted randomly to the alt.games.ultima.dragons newsgroup. It may
also be obtained by emailing Mono at <a
href="mailto:Monomolecular_Dragon@udic.org">Monomolecular_Dragon@udic.org</a>
and asking for the UDIC FAQ. Note that this is not an automated
service, but rather a real life person (at least, last time I
checked). It may also be obtained from the Ultima Dragons FTP
Archive, <a href="http://ftp.udic.org/ftpud/udic/">ftp://ftp.udic.org/pub/ud/udic/</a>.

have something you think should be included in this FAQ, email
Fallible. If it is pertinent, or if it has been suggested enough
times as to warrant being called &quot;frequent,&quot; chances
are it will turn up in the next version of this FAQ. Enjoy! :) </p>

<h2><a name="i1_0">1.0 THE ULTIMA DRAGONS AND ULTIMA DRAGONS -
INTERNET CHAPTER</a> </h2>

<h3><a name="i1_1">1.1: What are the Ultima Dragons?</a> </h3>

<p>The Ultima Dragons are a club, a virtual club to be exact. A
virtual club is defined as a group of people sharing a common
interest who are part of an organization that is based on a
computer network. Many of the members may never meet each other,
and it's this anonymity that makes these clubs so popular. </p>

<p>The Ultima Dragons are composed of people around the world who
share a common interest: Ultima. Though most of the members are,
as of now, in the United States, there are members in Australia,
Britain, Canada, Germany, and Singapore (to name but a few). </p>

<p>The primary goal of the Ultima Dragons is to help other Ultima
players with the games by providing assistance (plotwise or
technical) to the Ultima gaming community at large. Along the
same lines, a goal of the Ultima Dragons is to share experiences
with and knowledge of the series with other players and Dragons--
which includes discussion, debate, hypothesizing, and the like. </p>

<p>Just as important a goal of the Dragons is to promote
socialization among its members. One of the most notable
characteristics of the Ultima Dragons has always been the sense
of family (however dysfunctional it may be). </p>

<h3><a name="i1_2">1.2: Is there a difference between the plain
Ultima Dragons and Ultima Dragons - Internet Chapter (UDIC)?</a> </h3>

<p>Yes and no. &quot;Ultima Dragons&quot; alone refers to the
entire club, both past and present, and everything related to it.
&quot;Ultima Dragons - Internet Chapter&quot; refers specifically
to the club that exists on the Internet, but since there really
isn't an Ultima Dragons - Prodigy Chapter (so to speak) any more,
the plain &quot;Ultima Dragons&quot; is usually used to refer to
both. Also correct is the abbreviation UDIC, which stands for the
longer name. </p>

<p>The other difference is that the Internet version of the
Dragons does not have the government or rank system that the
Prodigy version had; this is but one of several such changes made
to the club in the adaptation process. </p>

<p>Why, then, is it still called UDIC, when it really isn't a
chapter of anything? That's a very good, still-unanswered
question. Probably, the reason it hasn't been changed yet is that
we've gotten used to calling it that already. </p>

<h3><a name="i1_3">1.3: What exactly do the Ultima Dragons do?</a>
</h3>

<p>The main goal of the Ultima Dragons is to render a service to
the Ultima-playing Internet community. This service mostly
pertains to assisting other players through tough spots in the
games; but also covers the discussions and debates about fine
points in the games themselves, whether it be talking of the
plots of the games, or wondering why something happened the way
it did instead of some other way, or even the technical aspects
of the Ultima series. This was also the prime motivator of the
Prodigy Dragons for most of that club's existence (not counting
GVT debates). In terms of assistance, the idea is that the
Dragons read through Ultima-related cries to help on the
newsgroup comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.rpg and answer them to the best
of their ability; although this is not specifically required, it
is the general idea behind the club. Ultima questions posted to
the alt.games.ultima.dragons newsgroup are also accepted. </p>

<p>The other, and in many respects just as equally important,
goal of the Ultima Dragons is to bring together and form bonds of
friendship between people from around the world who share Ultima
as a common interest. In this respect, conversations about things
other than Ultima are very likely to occur and, in most respects,
encouraged. This will be detailed more in the section below on
alt.games.ultima.dragons netiquette. </p>

<h3><a name="i1_4">1.4: How did UDIC come about?</a> </h3>

<p>By September 1994, a very large number of Dragons had given up
on <a href="http://www.prodigy.com/">Prodigy</a> and written the
Prodigy Dragons off as a lost cause. That month, it was
discovered that some Dragons had Internet email addresses, and
knew someone that knew someone else's address, and so on... the
upshot being that, in the space of roughly a week, about two
dozen Dragons had been reunited from across the United States. </p>

<p>Two of these Dragons, <a href="mailto:sbrindle@netcom.com">Ethereal
Dragon</a> (Stephen Brindle) and <a
href="mailto:dricket@netcom.com">Gold Dragon</a> (Doug Ricket,
the creator of the original club), had been idly discussing the
possibility of making an Internet version of the Dragons for
quite some time. Ethereal was the one gracious enough to actually
provide the utilities for it to become possible. The result was
Ultima Dragons - Internet Chapter (at the time, the Prodigy club
still existed, if only marginally). Ethereal was responsible for
proposing and then creating the alt.games.ultima.dragons Usenet
newsgroup, as well as the first Dragons FTP site. </p>

<p>It must be noted that, shortly after the creation of UDIC, the
original Prodigy club voted to abolish their governing body, and
(save for a few die-hard Dragons) was allowed to die. </p>

<h3><a name="i1_5">1.5: I would like to join the Dragons. How do
I do this?</a> </h3>

<p>If you can, fill out the WWW form. Its at: &lt;<a
href="join.html">http://www.udic.org/join.html</a>&gt;
It'll ask all the right questions and make sure its delivered to
the proper place. </p>

<p>If you can't access the WWW directly but you can telnet, then
telnet to info.funet.fi and log in as www. You can use that to
access the above URL. </p>

<p>If you can't do any of this but you can send email then send
email to <a href="mailto:join@udic.org">join@udic.org</a>.
Include your chosen dragon name (__ Dragon) your email address,
your real name, which Ultimas you've played and anything else you
feel like sending. This'll deliver it as well. </p>

<p>Where does this actually get delivered? Well, right now either
of these actions sends email to <a
href="mailto:Rainbow_Dragon@udic.org">Rainbow Dragon</a>
and <a href="http://www.dirtside.com/herrin/">Fallible Dragon</a>.
Fallible picks out the finger and WWW home page information to
update the web page. Rainbow checks your dragon name against the
roster. If it doesn't conflict with anyone else, he adds it and
forwards it on to one of several other dragons who send you a
message saying &quot;hi, welcome to the club&quot;. If it does
conflict, he lets you know and asks for you to send him a new
name. </p>

<p>The most basic membership information needed is that you must
have played an Ultima enough to have some base of knowledge on
it, and the willingness to help other people. The other
requirement is that you need to pick a name in the format
________ Dragon, where the space can be just about anything you
think sounds cool or fitting to your personality. For example, in
the old club, there was a Rendell Dragon, a Lady Dragon, an
Obsidian Dragon, a Whisper Dragon, and a Cathartic Bloodspree
Dragon; in the new club, there are names like SwiftHeart, Ancient
Balance, Parenthetical, and Seinentai Dragon. And just ask
someone if they can join. </p>

<p>You will be then given a copy of this FAQ for your very own
(ooh), a little rundown on what the Dragons do (depending on the
person giving it), and told to use the symbol -==(UDIC)==-
underneath your Dragon name to denote membership. Some Dragons
have taken to altering their .signature files in some way to
advertise their membership; while not required, it's a neat thing
to do. Look around on alt.games.ultima.dragons for some ideas.
Then, just jump right in. :) </p>

<h3><a name="i1_6">1.6: I know someone who used to be a Dragon
long ago (or am someone who used to be a Dragon). How do I get
them (or myself) in touch with the rest of the club?</a> </h3>

<p>Just stop on by alt.games.ultima.dragons and say hello and
reintroduce yourself and all that nice stuff. :) Also, email
Rapier Dragon at turnerw@aspen.uml.edu and let him know you're
back so he can add you to the memberlist. </p>

<p>Failing this, email Ethereal Dragon at sbrindle@netcom.com and
introduce yourself there, and see if he can't put you in touch
with the rest of us. :) </p>

<h3><a name="i1_7">1.7: Do you do anything else besides post to
a.g.u.d?</a> </h3>

<p>We read notes from a.g.u.d. :) But seriously. Other than the
help and discussion aspects on both that newsgroup and
comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.rpg, many Dragons like to converge on
Undernet IRC to chat (see section 1.8). </p>

<p>Many of us also tend to have Ultima-related hobbies in real
life as well. A few of us write Ultima stories in our spare time
(as a hobby). At least one Dragon has taken up playing Ultima
songs on his mandolin. </p>

<h3><a name="i1_8">1.8: What's this I hear about the Dragons' IRC
chats?</a> </h3>

<p>Many Dragons (the actual number varies from time to time)
often flock to the Undernet IRC every night to hang out and talk
and kill time, or to argue (wide grin to all the fellow IRCers).
The channel is 'officially' (not as if it matters) open at 9:00
P.M. Eastern time Friday through Sunday on Undernet IRC channel <strong>#udic</strong>.
However, in recent months there has been activity on every night
of the week, generally starting at around 6:30 P.M. Eastern.
These chats have a tendency to last well into the morning, until
the participants leave out of sheer fatigue. On Prodigy,
something similar used to occur; the participants would exchange
email and public messages until the system closed for the night.
This was known as 'Nighthawking.' It would appear that this
tendency is inherent to all Dragons... </p>

<p>To access the chat, one must have either an IRC client
installed or access to one. If there is no client on your system,
consider installing one. For users with UNIX-based systems with
2.5 megs free in their account, and the permission to do such, a
self-compiling IRC client can be installed by typing the command:
&quot;<samp>telnet sci.dixie.edu 1 | sh</samp>&quot; at the UNIX
prompt. </p>

<p>Once in IRC, you MUST switch your server to one on the
Undernet system using the /server command. A list of Undernet
servers follows: </p>

<p>For those with no IRC client and no means to acquire one, it
is possible to telnet to one of several public-access IRC
clients. Note that these sites all have a maximum limit of 15
connected to each address (usually, though, that's more than
enough). If one is full, simply connect to another one. If your
system has identd installed, the site will know to put your real
email address next to your name. The most recent list of these

<p>Note that it is CRUCIAL that you enter the port number. (Note
that on a VAX system, the format for the command is telnet
&lt;wherever&gt; /PORT=&lt;whatever&gt;) Once connected, the
command /join #udic will take you to the channel. The /nick
&lt;whatever&gt; command may be used to change your displayed
name. Anything you type that is not preceded by a / will be sent
to the channel for all to read; therefore, to send someone a
private message, use the command /msg &lt;whoever&gt;

command /me &lt;does whatever&gt;. And, to leave, just /signoff.

<h2><a name="i2_0">2.0 ALT.GAMES.ULTIMA.DRAGONS INFORMATION AND
NETIQUETTE</a> </h2>

<h2><a name="i2_1">2.1:</a> What is <a
href="news:alt.games.ultima.dragons">alt.games.ultima.dragons</a>?
</h2>

<p>This newsgroup is a forum created by and for Ultima fans to
talk about their favorite game, as well as socialize and increase
their own personal community of friends. Gamers seeking help with
the games may also ask questions here with a fairly good chance
of getting them answered (sometimes in ridiculous detail) within
a very short time. Alt.games.ultima.dragons also serves as the
&quot;home base&quot; of the Ultima Dragons - Internet Chapter,
and the prime hangout of many of them. </p>

<h3><a name="i2_2">2.2:</a> I'm not a Dragon. Can I participate
here? </h3>

<p>Sure! Just because the newsgroup name has the word Dragons in
it doesn't necessarily mean we're exclusionist, or that anybody
who posts there must join our club. The Dragons (who created the
newsgroup) welcome anybody in the community of Ultima gamers to
simply drop by and join an ongoing discussion or create a new
thread, or just chat. In fact, non-member participation is
encouraged in a.g.u.d (or, should be); the more Ultima fans
there, the merrier, even if they aren't Dragons. </p>

<h3><a name="i2_3">2.3:</a> Are there any Ultima celebrities
here? </h3>

<p>A definite yes. On the &quot;hey, that's neat!&quot; side, two
Dragons have been lucky enough to have been featured in Ultima
games over the years. Arbuthnot Dragon (William Jensen) was
featured in _Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny_, as well as mentioned
in the guidebook for _Ultima Underworld I: The Stygian Abyss_ as
being the original bearer of the Ring of Humility. In a more
visual appearance, Umbrae Dragon's (Jim Hammons) likeness was
used in _Ultima VII Part Two: Serpent Isle_ as the face of
Ensorcio, the mage in Sleeping Bull. </p>

<p>On the &quot;wow, this is really cool!&quot; side, a small
handful of current and ex-<a
href="http://www.origin.ea.com/english/">ORIGIN</a> staff
participate on alt.games.ultima.dragons from time to time. Brian
Martin, who is on the design team for _Ultima IX_, used the group
at one time for creative feedback in the creation of that game,
and continues to monitor it for the opinions of the posters as to
what constitutes the proverbial good Ultima game. Bill
Armintrout, whose name should be familiar enough to any Ultima
player who is in the habit of reading the credits for previous
Ultima games, also participates from time to time; he no longer
is involved with the production of Ultima, but is very
knowledgeable on the making of and reasoning behind the making of
several earlier Ultimas. Dr. Cat, who no longer works for ORIGIN
but is a very familiar personage (especially if you have played
_Ultima VI: The False Prophet_, also shows up from time to time.
His current project is a graphical MUD known as <a
href="http://www.realtime.net/~gauntlet/dspire.html">DragonSpires</a>,
which he is working on along with several other former ORIGIN
employees. The MUD is for PCs, and requires a special client that
is available for FTP at <a href="ftp://ftp.eden.com/pub/dspire/">ftp://ftp.eden.com/pub/dspire/</a>.

<h3><a name="i2_4">2.4:</a> Are there any special posting rules
on a.g.u.d? </h3>

<p>This is the technical netiquette section of this FAQ. Agud
follows the standard <a href="usenet.html">usenet nettiquette
conventions</a>. Basically, there are some common sense ones,
however; flame wars (while they have a nasty habit to spring up
in any concentration of Ultima Dragons members) waste more energy
and bandwidth than is necessary, and also has the incredibly
efficient ability of proving the immaturity of the participants.
So-called &quot;nasty language,&quot; while not precisely
prohibited (this is, after all, an unmoderated newsgroup), is
also somewhat unnecessary, as a few participants have young
children who like to read this group as well. Generally, if it's
not something you would say in a decent restaurant at a largish
table with a group of your friends and some of their friends,
don't say it here. If only to make it a pleasant place to hang
out and converse. </p>

<h3><a name="i2_5">2.5:</a> My news server doesn't get a.g.u.d.
How can I participate? </h3>

<p>This section pertains to those who can telnet but whose news
boxes don't get a.g.u.d for whatever reason. If you have a WWW
client, true, you can often access newsgroups that way, but
usually the news URLs (in the format news:name.of.group) point
the client to your local news machine, and if you don't get the
group in the first place... you get the idea. It used to be true
that one could telnet to library.wustl.edu and use the public
Lynx browser there to read Usenet news, including the
alt.games.ultima.dragons newsgroup; sadly, however, this is no
longer the case. </p>

<p>There is a definite workaround for posting -to- the newsgroup,
however. It is slow sometimes, and somewhat unreliable from time
to time, but is really better than nothing. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Address an email to <a
        href="mailto:alt-games-ultima-dragons@cs.utexas.edu">alt-games-ultima-dragons@cs.utexas.edu</a>
    </li>
    <li>The subject line can be whatever subject you want; as can
        the body of the message itself. </li>
</ul>

<p>The email will go to a mail-to-news gateway, and hopefully
show up in the newsgroup within a short amount of time. </p>

<p>Another method, recommended for those also with telnet and
willing to send mail to Cleveland, Ohio, USA, is the Cleveland
Freenet. CFn allows reading and posting to Usenet newsgroups
(over 6000 of them) from there. Email Monomolecular Dragon at <a
href="mailto:Monomolecular_Dragon@udic.org">Monomolecular_Dragon@udic.org</a>
for more information. </p>

<h3><a name="i2_6">2.6:</a> These people aren't talking about
Ultima all the time. Is this okay? </h3>

<p>Well, since one of the other main missions of the Dragons (and
therefore, the newsgroup) is the promotion of socialization and
the &quot;getting-to-know-each-other&quot; bit, it's perfectly
acceptable. Most people try to strike a fair balance between
Ultima-related and non-Ultima-related posts, though, but
discussions about topics as diverse (and odd) as spheres,
Cinnabons, and Enya. </p>

<p>(by Rak Dragon) </p>

<p>And there [is] (supposed) to be more to this club than Ultima.
If you just wanted a purely Ultima group, then go create
comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.rpg.ultima. What I am trying to say that
[sic]this group is a society. The fact that every post is not
Ultima - related (or even the great majority) is not bad... This
club goes beyond Ultima... </p>

<h3><a name="i2_7">2.7:</a> Why are there so many weird people on
here? </h3>

<p>Back in ancient Sosaria, Mondain had a twin brother Bernie.
Bernie's greatest accomplishment was the creation of the Gem of
Spam which, when it was accidentally shattered by the Stranger
(who was on his way to Mondain's Apartment o' Doom) really
smelled and looked icky. But later, when Perrier was accidentally
spilt on the squishy mess that had once been Spam but was now...
well, bits of Spam... a utterly pointless and uninteresting yet
obviously real machine known as the Bizarre-o-tron was born. This
machine was somehow forced into the Ethereal Void, where it pumps
out waves of weirdness all across the Sub-Etha, including the
Internet. Hence, the weird people on alt.games.ultima.dragons. </p>

<p>See? Actually, it seems that due to the diversity of views and
hobbies of the Dragons (and other participants), everyone has
some sort of bent world view that, when applied in the social
context of the newsgroup, just makes things real nice and fun. A
lot see this newsgroup as a way to unwind with friends;
naturally, such situations tend to lead to frivolity and goofing
off. </p>

<h2><a name="i3_0">3.0 GENERAL INFORMATION ON ULTIMA</a> </h2>

<h3><a name="i3_1">3.1:</a> What the heck is Ultima? </h3>

<p>Ultima is the name of a tremendously successful series of
computer role playing games by <a
href="http://www.origin.ea.com/english/">ORIGIN</a>/<a
href="http://www.ea.com/">Electronic Arts</a>. The series began
in 1980 with the eponymous first game, conceived and written by <a
href="http://www.origin.ea.com/english/#RG">Richard Garriot</a>
and published by California Pacific. Since then, there have been
twelve additional games in the series and two add-on disks. But
then, if you're reading this FAQ, you must have -some- clue what
Ultima is. :) </p>

<h3><a name="i3_2">3.2:</a> Who makes Ultima? </h3>

<p>Ultima is a product of <a
href="http://www.origin.ea.com/english/">ORIGIN Systems, Inc.</a>,
an <a href="http://www.origin.ea.com/english/">Electronic Arts</a>
Company, based in Austin, Texas (USA). The series was created by <a
href="http://www.origin.ea.com/english/#RG">Richard Garriot</a>
in 1980 with the release of the game &quot;<a
href="http://www.owo.com/archive/ultima1/">Ultima</a>&quot;
for the Apple computer by California Pacific. Because California
Pacific went out of business in 1981, Sierra On-Line published
&quot;<a href="http://www.owo.com/archive/ultima2/">Ultima
][: Revenge of the Enchantress</a>&quot; in 1982. Following the
success of those two games, Richard, his brother Robert, his
father Owen, and Chuck Bueche formed ORIGIN Systems, Inc. in
1983. Following the release of &quot;<a
href="http://www.owo.com/archive/ultima6/">Ultima
VI: The False Prophet</a>&quot; in 1990, ORIGIN became affiliated
with Electronic Arts; however, <a
href="http://www.origin.ea.com/english/#RG">Richard Garriot</a>
remains the chief evil genius behind the Ultima line. ORIGIN is
also responsible for the tremendously successful &quot;Wing
Commander&quot; series. </p>

<h3><a name="i3_3">3.3:</a> What's the general storyline? </h3>

<p>In the first <a
href="http://www.owo.com/archive/ultima1/">Ultima</a>,
you had to stop the evil wizard Mondain from completely
overrunning the four continents of the planet Sosaria and end his
reign of terror. In the <a
href="http://www.owo.com/archive/ultima2/">sequel</a>,
you had to travel through several periods of time to find
Mondain's child bride and prodigy Minax and undo the destruction
she did to Earth. <a
href="http://www.owo.com/archive/ultima3/">Ultima
]I[: Exodus</a> takes place on Sosaria again. This time, you and
a party of adventurers must find and defeat Exodus, Mondain and
Minax's offspring, and restore peace to Sosaria. These first
three games are often referred to as the <a
href="http://www.owo.com/archive/trilogy1.html">First
Trilogy</a>, or the <a
href="http://www.owo.com/archive/trilogy1.html">Triad
of Evil</a>. </p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.owo.com/archive/ultima4/">Ultima
IV: Quest of the Avatar</a>, Lord British has united Sosaria,
which changes it's name to Britannia in celebration. You are
called back at the behest of Lord British to recover the Codex of
Ultimate Wisdom, and in doing so become the Avatar, the
embodiment of Virtue, as well as Britannia's moral role model. In
<a href="http://www.owo.com/archive/ultima5/">Ultima
V: Warriors of Destiny</a>, Lord British has been captured and a
tyrant has assumed the throne. You must defeat the true evil
behind Lord Blackthorn, rescue Lord British, and return him to
his rightful throne. In <a
href="http://www.owo.com/archive/ultima6/">Ultima
VI: The False Prophet</a>, Britannia has been overrun by
Gargoyles, who have captured the Shrines of the Virtues. You, as
the Avatar, must discover the reason behind the attacks and put
an end to them. These three games are sometimes referred to as
the <a
href="http://www.owo.com/archive/trilogy2.html">Second
Trilogy</a>. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.owo.com/archive/ultima7/">Ultima
VII: The Black Gate</a> takes place 200 years after Ultima VI.
Mysterious murders have been happening in Britannia, and a new
organization, The Fellowship, seems to be at fault. Plus, the
Avatar must solve the mystery of the Guardian, a mystery that
could destroy Britannia. The add-on disk for Ultima VII, Forge of
Virtue, sends the Avatar on a quest to the Isle of Fire to learn
the meaning of Truth, Love, and Courage, the three great
Principles of Britannia. The story continues in <a
href="http://www.owo.com/archive/ultima72/">Ultima
VII Part Two: Serpent Isle</a>, a stand-alone game that finds the
Avatar and company sent to a mythical lost country to track down
Batlin, the head of The Fellowship, and also discover the
Guardian's plans. In the process, the Avatar must unlock the
secrets of that land and restore Balance to it. An add-on disk
for U7-2, Silver Seed, sends the Avatar back in time to the
middle of the war between the armies of Chaos and Order. Like
Forge of Virtue, this add-on disk builds the Avatar's stats up
and gives him really nifty items. </p>

<p>Indirectly, this story continues in <a
href="http://www.owo.com/archive/ultima8/">Ultima
VIII: Pagan</a>, the most recent installment of Ultima. The
Guardian has deposited the Avatar alone on a dying world
dominated by four great Titans. Against all cost, the Avatar must
defeat the Titans and escape Pagan to stop the Guardian's plan to
take over Britannia. </p>

<p>These eight games form the core storyline of Ultima. There
are, however, four other games in the line. The first two were
produced by LookingGlass Technologies, and feature a
virtual-reality type interface. The first of these, <a
href="http://www.owo.com/archive/uw1/">Ultima
Underworld: The Stygian Abyss</a>, sends the Avatar deep into the
heart of a volcano to rescue a princess and stop an evil mage.
The second one takes place between U7-1 and U7-2. In <a
href="http://www.owo.com/archive/uw2/">Ultima
Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds</a>, the Guardian has encased
Castle British in a mysterious Blackrock gem, and it is up to the
Avatar to travel deep underground in search of a way to destroy
it. The other two Ultimas are the &quot;<a
href="http://www.owo.com/archive/wou.html">Worlds of
Ultima</a>&quot; series, consisting of <a
href="http://www.owo.com/archive/savage/">Worlds of
Ultima: Savage Empire</a> and <a
href="http://www.owo.com/archive/martian/">Worlds of
Ultima: Martian Dreams</a>. These games are separate from the
Sosaria/Britannia stories. </p>

<p>(by Fire Dragon) </p>

<p><a href="http://www.owo.com/archive/savage/">Savage
Empire</a>: The Avatar went to the lab of his friend, who just
happens to be a scientist. Anyway, something happens, and they
get blown back in time/space, to a place where all sorts of
dinosaurs &amp; pre-historic men lived. The A's goal is to make
it back to his home time/place. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.owo.com/archive/martian/">Martian
Dreams</a>: The big A goes back in time at the request of a
woman. He ends up in the 19th century, and gets rocketed to Mars
to rescue an expedition. He discovers these things called
&quot;dream machines&quot;, where Martians have decided to stay
for their own safety, due to pestilence that the foul Raxachk (I
think that's his name) has unleashed on Mars. You also have to
free major players of the Victorian era (Nellie Bly, Mark Twain,
Louis Tiffany, etc. etc.). </p>

<h3><a name="i3_4">3.4:</a> Where can I get an Ultima game? </h3>

<p>Your local software retailer would be your best bet for the
most recent Ultima release (as well as other fine ORIGIN titles).
ORIGIN has also released a CD-ROM containing Ultimas I-VI, a
CD-ROM containing the complete Ultima VII, and an Ultima VIII
CD-ROM collection. In addition, one of the Ultima Underworlds is
available on CD-ROM bundled with Wing Commander II: Vengeance of
the Kilrathi. Usually, these CD-ROMs exist as delivery material
only; that is, the software must still be installed to the hard
drive before playing. These titles may also be ordered direct
from ORIGIN. All games are IBM compatible only; even though the
original games were on the Apple, there are no games currently
for the Macintosh (and no immediate plans for any, either). The
general price range for these games is between $30 and $50 US,
although some have reported seeing Ultima VIII for a low as $12.
There are also Nintendo and Super Nintendo editions of Ultima, as
well as the Game Boy Ultima: Runes of Virtue. General consensus
in the Ultima community is that the computer versions are overall
much better, however. </p>

ELSE IN THIS FAQ EASILY </h2>

<p><a href="mailto:Monomolecular_Dragon@udic.org">Monomolecular
Dragon</a>, aka Barry Ramirez, joined the Prodigy Dragons on
February 17, 1993, after completing U7-1. In very late June 1993
he was nominated and elected to Grand Council, a seat which he
stubbornly held until that club's demise in September 1994. He is

<h3><a name="i5_2">5.2:</a> History of this FAQ </h3>

<p>The most recent edition of the old FAQ was dated November 28,
1994. For all purposes and intents that old FAQ is being
considered the Version 1.0 FAQ, even if it had suffered whatever
updates (there was at least one to it). The first edition of the
new FAQ is numbered Version 2.0, and this sequence will hopefully
be followed for as long as someone is doing the FAQ. As expected,
the number after the decimal will be increased with each minor
revision or correction or contribution (but -not- with each
posting) and the number before the decimal will change with each
major new release; i.e., with a new section, or completely
rewritten section, or change in format, or whatever. </p>

<p>For reference, this FAQ was generally patterned after Michael
Wang's &quot;Internet PC Games FAQ;&quot; the general format was
used in the writing of Version 2.0 of this document because Barry
really has no clue how a FAQ should be organized. </p>

<p>Version 2.0 was finished on December 30, 1994, and released on
the same day.<br>
Version 2.1 was finished on January 13, 1995 but never posted. <br>
Version 2.11 was a last-minute on-Line revision of V2.1, done on
January 15, 1995, shortly before posting to
alt.games.ultima.dragons. <br>
Version 3.0 was a complete redraft and reorganization, finished
on February 13, 1995, and posted the same day.<br>
Version 3.1 was converted to HTML and updated by Fallible Dragon
on May 1, 1995. </p>

<h3><a name="i5_3">5.3:</a> Odd Dragon Things (originally by
Ethereal Dragon, revised by Monomolecular Dragon) </h3>

<p>This lingo is rather foreign to most members of the net, and
rightfully so: it is personal and obsolete. The newer, hipper
crowd of Dragons will probably not use these sayings, but you may
catch a few old timers spitting them out like they were tiny
seeds harvested in rich soil, warmed by the nurturing sun and
cool spring rains, blossoming into beautiful trees...Well, enough
of that poetic crap. Let's cut to the chase. </p>

<p>- NMPR<br>
No more public replies. The software on Prodigy would blast you
with this not very friendly message if you tried to post publicly
to a note that was scheduled for deletion, whatever the reason
may have been. When starting a new note but staying on the same
topic, Dragons would prefix the note with the line, &quot;Damn! I
got NMPRed! Anyway, as I was saying...&quot;, or something to
that effect. </p>

<p>- JP<br>
Junk post. A junk post is defined as a useless waste of net
bandwidth that serves no purpose. They can be pretty fun,
actually. JPs come in many varieties: ramblings, meaningless
lists, and just plain silly. </p>

<p>- Anadaking<br>
I admit, I made this one up on my own. But don't you agree that
it should be a part of our extended Dragon vocabulary? Anyway,
Anadak Dragon, once in a fit of boredom from being home sick from
school as well as being frustrated that he had not been promoted,
posted over a hundred short and pointless notes in under half an
hour. The notes were incredibly wasteful of bandwidth and
cluttered up the subjects for many hours thereafter, and at that
time Prodigy had not yet implemented twit lists. So, Anadaking
(or any variant thereof) is posting a large number of unnecessary
notes with no content. </p>

<p>- :*, B), &amp;, etc.<br>
Many Dragons had ASCII symbols that, over the months (or maybe
years), had become instantly associated with them. :* was
Whisper's kiss, as she has a certain fondness of putting kisses
in her messages. B) was Sun's symbol; sunglasses, natch. The
&amp; is Umbrae's symbol, and I have no clue what -that- is
supposed to represent... </p>

<p>- G@C, GC, GVT<br>
All three of these acronyms are shorthand for the Grand Council,
but GVT encompasses the Grand Council and all the circle leaders
and honor circle members. Since we have no circle system anymore,
it is useless to explain it in this FAQ. If you really want to
know, ask one of the old Dragons. </p>

<p>- Any strange 2 or 3 letter word that is used when referring
to another member<br>
It's tiresome to write out Dragon names again and again,
especially when you are referring to Monomolecular Dragon or
Demented Cheez Wiz Dragon. Therefore, nicknames are quickly
developed. Some examples include Beo (for Beowolf), Chammy (for
Chameleon), DV (for Dark Vengeance), Eth (for Ethereal), Mono
(for Monomolecular), etc. And then, of course, there are
nicknames that are just as long as the regular names, but
slightly less formal, like Whispie (for Whisper). Share your
nickname with the Dragon crowd. </p>

<p>- UG/Lair (by Fire Dragon)<br>
&quot;UnderGround&quot;, which was a way to circumvent *P* board
access times &amp; E-mail costs. The originator would set aside a
spare ID I.E. MVJP37A would open up MVJP37D for use (MVJP37B
being my original ID... oh, how long ago, when that shit network
was worth something.) by himself and several other people. He
would give the ID &amp; p-word, and several users would use the
account. Instead of sending an e-mail to an actual ID, in the
&quot;TO:&quot; field, one would put &quot;Hey, Cathartic,&quot;,
and write 6 pages of their message. *P* then flagged the term UG
from then on... </p>

<p>[These became known as Lairs after Prodigy started deleting
-any- message containing the letters U and G next to each other.
A -lot- of things happened on these lairs.] </p>

<p>- OBD<br>
Operation Blue Duck, a conspiracy that it just too complicated to
explain in short order. Maybe we'll get one of the members to
write a complete thesis on it which we can store at the FTP site.
</p>

<p>- Skyblade's Wet Noodle Of Death<br>
Um... this is a product of Skyblade Dragon, plain and simple... </p>

<h3><a name="i5_4">5.4:</a> A Brief Chronology of the Ultima
Dragons </h3>

<p>I tried to be more or less accurate with this. Any mistakes
included are due simply to the sketchiness level of the notes I
was working off of. In keeping this list as brief as possible,
many crucial events seem to have been downplayed or ignored.
This, however, is intended to be only a general overview of the
history of the Dragons. I am, theoretically, working on a longer
history file which will cover these events in as much detail as
my notes allow. </p>

<p><strong>1990 - Prehistory (before anything cool was happening)</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>1991 - First Era(the birth of Ultima clubs)</strong> </p>

<p>- Evil Avatars (EAs) and Guppes (Good Ultima Players Pounding
Evil Slime, by some accounts) formed on Prodigy (founders and
date uncertain) </p>

<p>- Guppes change name to PVLBs (Protectors of Virtue and Lord
British) </p>

<p>- &quot;Operation Morleycide:&quot; Personal conflict between
two EAs leads to one (Morley) creating Warriors of Tyranny. The
EAs flame WOT into submission. </p>

<p><strong>1992 - Second Era (the creation and growth of the
Ultima Dragons)</strong> </p>

<p>- Prodigy revamps bulletin boards, loosening restrictions on
posting </p>

<p>- Knights of Anarchy founded by Vargo (friend of Morley). EAs
begin similar actions as Operation Morleycide. </p>

<p>- Players of Ultima For Fun (PUFF) formed by Doug Ricket
(February 27, 1992) </p>

<p>- Following a taunt by Scorpion (an EA, the phrase was
&quot;PUFF the Magic Dragon&quot;), Doug Ricket renames PUFF to
Ultima Dragons. </p>

<p>- Gold Dragon (Ricket) invents Dragon government system (the
Grand Council). </p>

<p>- Dragon member roster begins building to the total 200-300
members it would eventually have at one point. </p>

<p>- After being personally hurt by miscommunication, Copper
Dragon begins creation of various Dragon policies and ranks with
the end result of him having access to and some control of the
Dragon GVT for long stretches at a time. </p>

<p>- &quot;United Clubs of Ultima:&quot; proposed by a group of
Dragons and EAs to unite the various Ultima clubs on Prodigy into
one unit. Did not pass in EA voting, passed in Dragons. Later
learned the vote was rigged *pro* UCU in the Eas. </p>

<p>- Copper Dragon continues revenge against current Grand
Council. Eventually, his membership is suspended. </p>

<p>- Evil Avatars and PVLBs begin to fade from the political
limelight. </p>

<p>- &quot;Aaron:&quot; Aaron forms clubs with names similar to
the other clubs. Several Dragons band together and harass him for
this. Aaron retaliates by initiating a flame war. He would revive
his grudge at frequent intervals over the next two years,
including one (so far) stint in UDIC. </p>

<p>- &quot;The Exodus:&quot; The entire Dragon Grand Council
abdicates, leaving power vacuum. Several Dragons elect themselves
to fill the space and try to rebuild the club. Rules of operation
(the &quot;Tomb&quot;) codified. </p>

<p><strong>1993 - Third Era (the Dragons' dominance and inner
corruption).</strong> </p>

<p>- &quot;Sylvan's Snowball Fight:&quot; Turmoil of the Exodus
and GVT rebuild continues. Sylvan Dragon starts a virtual
'snowball fight' as a (rather successful, if only briefly)
diversion. </p>

<p>- &quot;Matrix:&quot; more of the same flame wars that became
in Dragon vogue. I don't remember much of this one, actually. </p>

<p>- &quot;Chammy's Convention:&quot; During a Dragon convention
at Chameleon Dragon's house, someone posts notes harassing
Whisper Dragon. End result is further instability in the GVT,
including the impeachment of Spectacle Dragon and the eventual
resignation of Aiel Dragon. </p>

<p>- Prodigy, in an attempt to recover from losses, raises
prices. This forces a large number of old-core Dragons to leave. </p>

<p>- &quot;Operation Blue Duck:&quot; Copper Dragon, still
holding to his grudge, enlists Dark Vengeance to try to cause
major political change in the Dragons. Dark Vengeance brings in
several other dragons, with his own agenda being the political
and emotional humiliation of Whisper Dragon. Copper backs out and
tells Whisper. Using this information, the Grand Council, over
the space of a week, gathers enough evidence of the conspiracy to
force it public. The aftershocks keep things pretty ugly for most
of the rest of the Prodigy Dragons' existence. </p>

<p>- Storm Dragon attempts to create Ultima Dragons - Florida
Chapter. This does not go over well with certain other Dragons,
due to Storm's involvement in Blue Duck. </p>

<p>- Also in 1993 there were several virtual Dragon marriages:
Rendell Dragon to Iridescent Dragon; Lady Dragon to Aiel Dragon;
Sylvan Dragon to Ebony Dragon; and Grignard Dragon to Whisper
Dragon. </p>

<p><strong>1994 - Fourth Era (The fall of the Prodigy Dragons and
the birth of UDIC)</strong> </p>

<p>- Dragons member roster falls to roughly a dozen members, many
without direct Prodigy access. </p>

<p>- Many Dragons begin discovering that they all have some form
of Internet access. Within the space of a couple of weeks 24
Dragons are reunited. </p>

<p>- Ultima Dragons - Internet Chapter formed by Stephen Brindle
and Doug Ricket (August 1994) </p>

<p>- Prodigy Dragons finally vote to abolish government,
effectively marking the death of that club. </p>

<p>- Decision made to have UDIC remain government-free. </p>

<p>- USENET newsgroup <a href="news:alt.games.ultima.dragons">alt.games.ultima.dragons</a>
created to continue the original tradition of the old club, that
of helping Ultima players. First international members. Member
roster, counting infrequent posters, jumps to 60+ members in the
space of a week. </p>

<p>- ORIGIN design team representatives suddenly and wonderfully
appear in the newsgroup. </p>

<p>- Aaron returns... </p>

<p><strong>1995 - Fifth Era (continued expansion of UDIC ???)</strong>
</p>

<p>- Another virtual Dragon marriage, between Monomolecular
Dragon and his RL girlfriend Kitten (Kittydwagon). </p>

<p>- Greeting team formed by Fallible Dragon to welcome new
members and manage the member roster (May 1995). </p>

<h3>5.5: Why do older Dragons despise Prodigy? </h3>

<p>The Ultima Dragons used to exist completely on Prodigy,
between its inception in early 1992 and early Fall 1994. Before
July 1993, Prodigy's price schedule was such that clubs like the
Dragons were possible. When Prodigy decided to raise prices and
adopt an hourly charge for bulletin board usage in July 1993
(much to the outraged protest of the board users), it became
financially difficult for many members to participate, and the
membership practically halved overnight. Those that could stay
did so only with great difficulty. </p>

<p>Many older Dragons (that is, pre-UDIC Dragons) are still angry
at Prodigy because so many good Dragons (and friends) were lost
at that time. With such a sense of family that the Dragons had
(and have), the event was akin to losing a close friend or loved
one. There are other reasons for the hatred, but this is the main
one. </p>

<h3><a name="i5_6">5.6:</a> What was the Ultima Dragons like
before coming to the Internet? </h3>

<p>The clearest definition that anyone can hope to use to
describe the Prodigy club is that of a dysfunctional family full
of sibling rivalry. It rivaled even some TV soap operas in terms
of viciousness and inter-personal conflict. This mood was a
result of the combination of members leaving due to price hikes,
a series of problems with mismanagement, real life problems, and
the general bitter attitude most Prodigy clubs had (or have). If
one were to talk to an old member and ask about government
intrigue, conspiracies, and bashing, the response would most
likely be angered and full of bitterness at the memories. </p>

<p>Paradoxically, however, the Prodigy Dragons were still a
family, or at the very least mostly a tightly-knit group of
friends. Dragon Conventions were held every so often in various
locations. These rather fun events allowed members to meet each
other face to face, get to know each other better, and raid each
other's refrigerators. In fact, the bonds of friendship that
formed were often so strong that at least four Dragons, two
couples, fell in love and were married in real life. Just as
paradoxically, many an old Dragon is likely to speak of the fun
times in Vinnie's Pizza or the Drunken Stupor (pub-type things on
Prodigy created by a few of the dominant Ultima clubs), or of
diving from a sailboat at a Convention, or reading the notes that
just made us laugh. </p>

<p>Many members of the time, though, will describe the Prodigy
Dragons in only two words: sheer hell. </p>

<h3><a name="i5_7">5.7:</a> What is GVT and why are so many
people talking about it? </h3>

<p>GVT is shorthand for government, and refers to the system the
Prodigy Dragons used to keep track of members and such. On
Prodigy, it was not uncommon for clubs like the Dragons to have a
form of government, with ranks and stuff like that. The system
worked fairly well for a while, but was rife with scandal and
crises and insult and vendetta and grudge, and affected many of
the members in a very negative manner. Many Dragons quit because
of or due to their experiences with the GVT; the majority of
Dragons who survived the GVT scandals and pessimism to form UDIC
still loathe the concept of having another GVT system. Luckily
for it, the Prodigy Dragons officially abolished their GVT in a
unanimous vote in September 1994, but since there were only a
literal handful of members still there, it wasn't as difficult as
it had been in the past. </p>

<p>The anti-GVT sentiment is echoed by a lot of newer members
who, although had never born witness to the perpetual headache
that was the GVT, have been long- time Internet citizens and
naturally tend to be aversive to governing systems in general. </p>

<p>The reason it is still such a hot topic is a debate between
those that see a need for a committee of some sort to oversee the
mundane aspects of the club (the member list, processing new
members, FTP site and FAQ maintenance, etc.) and those that are,
for whatever reason, opposed to such a system for any reason. </p>

<h3><a name="i5_8">5.8:</a> What are all the odd things people
keep mentioning from time to time? </h3>

<p>This will quite likely take some time, so feel free to skip on
through unless you're real interested. Only some of the most
talked about stuff is mentioned here. </p>

<p>It has been mentioned that, in addition to Ultima help,
politics also played a large role in the Dragons (and indeed, in
the other Ultima clubs on Prodigy). In mid- to late-1992, there
was a proposal called UCU, which was short for United Clubs of
Ultima. It would unify all the Ultima clubs on Prodigy into one
single unit. The two big players in UCU were the Dragons and the
Evil Avatars (an interesting story in themselves). Operating
behind the scenes was a group of people who were conspiring to
rig the vote in favor of passage of UCU. Initially, in the
Dragons, the Grand Council (the government) was against UCU, but
when it came time to vote, it passed. In the Evil Avatars, the
Triumvirate (the EA government) and EA members voted and rejected
the UCU plan. It was discovered some time later that there was a
group of both Eas and Dragons who had attempted to rig the vote,
and that this group had gained uninvited access to the private
conversation rooms of the respective club governments. </p>

<p>After news of this conspiracy broke, a chain of events was set
in on both sides that would lead to, in November 1992, the entire
Ultima Dragons Grand Council simultaneously stepping down and
leaving to form their own club, Township. Aiel Dragon, Gremlin
Dragon, and several others rushed to fill the sudden power vacuum
and attempt to rebuild what had suddenly shattered. This event
was known as the Exodus, and is widely regarded as one of the
causes of the Prodigy Dragons' eventual destruction: after it, no
clear decisions on how to rebuild the Dragons could be made, and
the subsequent flame wars weakened both the Dragons and the
members therein. </p>

<p>Operation Blue Duck represents the government idiocy taken to
an extreme, and happens at the other end of the timeline from UCU
and the Exodus (and, incidentally, can be shown to be a result of
both). Very briefly, a group of Dragons and a non-Dragon tried to
rig a Grand Council election in September 1993, to prevent
Whisper Dragon (Tina Haumersen, who had long been a favored
target, and unfairly so, of several Dragons for flamage) from
gaining the open seat and, hopefully, to have her kicked out from
the Dragons entirely. In response, the Grand Council and several
other Dragons government members planned and executed Operation
Blue Duck (the name is just one of those odd things) to forestall
this coup. The conspirators were revealed and, were it not for
the fact that the Prodigy Dragons were already on a terminal
downslide at this point in time, everybody lived more or less
dysfunctional ever after. (More information can be obtained from
the author of this FAQ by email, as Monomolecular Dragon was the
one who planned Blue Duck to begin with and is more or less the
definitive source on what happened.) </p>

<h3><a name="i5_9">5.9:</a> General policies of the Ultima
Dragons (by Ethereal Dragon) </h3>

<p>Due to the absence of a government, these rules can not be
stressed. They have bled over from our Prodigy days, where they
were sort of the golden rules of the club. A constitution was
written there, but it has not been, and probably won't be,
enacted in UDIC. </p>

<p>These moral standards were practically forced on us, to be
exact. Prodigy had (has?) a very strict policy of what you could
and could not post. So, all the members of the club had to get
into the habit of not swearing and not bashing other people.
Along with that, proper netiquette, which you should be following
anyway, is pretty much the basis for these morals. </p>

<p>- In order to join the club, a person must have played (not
completed) at least 1 Ultima on any platform. </p>

<p>- When talking with other members, and especially when posting
notes in the newsgroup, stay away from &quot;heavy&quot; topics
like abortion, religion, etc. At least, you CAN, but just do it
via e-mail. And don't come whining if you completely destroy your
friendship with that Dragon. </p>

<p>- Respect ALL members of the club, regardless of the real life
lives they lead. </p>

<p>- Try to answer peoples' Ultima questions in
comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.rpg. Even answering one question a week is
better than answering none at all. </p>

<p>- Your level of participation in the club is a personal
decision, but you will generally be more liked and you will like
the club more if you post in our newsgroup, help others with
their Ultima queries, send any interesting Ultima related files
you think should be up on the FTP site to Ethereal Dragon, and
try to come to at least ONE IRC chat party. [See Section 1.8 for
more information on the IRC chats.] </p>

<p>- Most importantly, HAVE FUN! </p>
