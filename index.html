                <p>The Ultima Dragons are a large virtual club founded in 1992 on Prodigy who have
                since moved to the Internet due to Prodigy's outrageous rate structure. The club is
                dedicated to helping others with their Ultima questions, discussing Ultima, and,
                most obviously, sharing information and creative exploits.</p>

                <p>If you have played an Ultima, are willing to help others with their Ultima
                questions, and would like to be a member of the Ultima Dragons, please <a
                href="#join">fill out the join form</a> (Or e-mail join@udic.org with your real
                name, e-mail address, and chosen Dragon name). A Dragon on the greeting team will
                send you email within a week, welcoming you to the club.</p>

                <h2>Dragon Requirements</h2>

                <h3>A message from Fallible Dragon...</h3>

                <p>You are viewing this message either because you are concerned about giving out
                your real name, or because you haven't yet played an Ultima. These are requirements
                for joining, and I'll address each in turn.</p>

                <p>First, where it asks for real name, you have to type in your real name. If
                you're really concerned, you can use your first initial and your last name. But it
                has to be your real name. The whole thing. "John" alone won't cut it. We want to see
                "John Doe"; or "J. Doe".</p>

                <p>This is a question of honesty and respect. You being honest with the rest of the
                club and respecting us, and the rest of the club respecting you in return. How can
                we respect you if you don't feel we're worthy of knowing your name? If you really
                don't want to give out your real name, then you're welcome to lurk and participate
                in the activities, but please don't waste your time by filling out an application.
                </p>

                <p>Second, you have to have played an Ultima in order to be in the Ultima Dragons.
                The members of this club come from all ages, from all over the world, and from all
                walks of life. The common thread that binds us is that we all play and love Ultima.
                If you don't play Ultima or don't like Ultima then quite frankly you won't fit in.
                </p>

                <p>If you've met some Dragons, like the group, and are really interested in joining,
                yet haven't played an Ultima then there is a solution for you: Go buy an Ultima and
                play for about a week. Get the one that you'll like best. Ultima IV is the classic,
                but the technology is old. Ultima Underworld is satisfying for folks who like Doom.
                Ultima VII part II is pretty good for you if you want to get into the more recent
                games in the Ultima series. Whatever. The point is, find out if you like Ultima
                before you join.</p>

                <p>Now, there's no test for any of this. Unless you're blatantly obvious, we'll take
                you at your word. But if you lie, eventually we'll find out and then your membership
                will be very publicly revoked.</p>

                <p>So please, play an Ultima and use your real name. If you're an Ultima lover like
                the rest of us, then we want you to be one of us.</p>

                <p>
                    Sincerely,<br>
                    Fallible Dragon<br>

                <dl class="accordion">

                    <dt>What is the UDIC?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>UDIC stands for Ultima Dragons Internet Chapter. Its a social club on the
                        Internet whose members share a common interest: the Ultima series of games
                        by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_Systems">Origin Systems,
                        Inc</a>. The club has more than 9,000 members throughout the world. Members
                        chat, share Ultima clues, and generally have fun.</p>

                        <p>The Ultima Dragons were originally created on February 27, 1992 on
                        Prodigy. They were disbanded in early 1994, but were reestablished on the
                        Internet later that year as the Ultima Dragons Internet Chapter. Since the
                        Prodigy Ultima Dragons club no longer exists, Ultima Dragons can be used to
                        refer to the UDIC.</p>
                    </dd>

                    <dt>How do I join the UDIC?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>If you can, fill out the <a href="#join">form</a>. It'll ask all the
                        right questions and make sure its delivered to the proper place.</p>

                        <p>If you can't use the form but you can send email then send email to <a
                        href="mailto:join@udic.org">join@udic.org</a>. Include your chosen dragon
                        name (__ Dragon) your email address, your real name, which ultimas you've
                        played and anything else you feel like sending.</p>

                        <p>Where does this actually get delivered? A team of ten to twenty club
                        members (the Greeting team) receives and analyzes your application, and
                        stores it in the <a href="members/">online membership roster</a>.</p>

                        <p>The only entrance requirement is that you must have played at least one
                        Ultima game. Thats one of the reasons why any dragon can let you in to the
                        club. But, to make it on to the roster you need to do one of the two things
                        above.</p>
                    </dd>

                    <dt>What if I was in the Ultima Dragons on Prodigy?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>Also, for any of you out there who were members of the Prodigy club
                        before it disbanded, a few quick notes:</p>

                        <p>1) Welcome back, we're glad to have you.</p>

                        <p>2) Please follow the insturctions in "How do I join the UDIC?" for
                        joining the club so that you will be on the roster.</p>

                        <p>3)To denote membership in the club, we put a -==(UDIC)==- in our
                        .signature files (so that they're included at the end of our posts). There
                        are no other ranks, offices or government in this club. Most dragons are
                        against creating any sort of government and posting your old prodigy rank as
                        anything other than a joke is the closest thing we have to a faux pas.</>

                        <p>4) The newsgroup (<a
                        href="news:rec.games.computer.ultima-dragons">rec.games.computer.ultima-dragons</a>)
                        is on the usenet. So, we more or less follow the usenet nettiquette
                        conventions, NOT Prodigy's posting conventions. If you're new to the
                        internet and the usenet then I <strong>strongly reccomend </strong> you <a
                        href="#usenet">read the nettiquette FAQ</a> on the newsgroup <a
                        href="news:news.announce.newusers">news.announce.newusers</a> <em>before you
                        post</em>. If you're an old hand on the usenet then read the nettiquette FAQ
                        anyway: It can't hurt to refresh your memory.</p>

                        <p>5)There are no official leaders in the club. If you want to know who
                        fills the rolls (the 'defacto' leaders) then read the newsgroup for a couple
                        weeks. If you want to be a leader, then be active in the club and find a
                        niche to fill (or a filled niche that isn't being done well enough). Like
                        the shoe commercial says, Just do it. </p>

                        <p>6) This club was created Fall '94 by <a
                        href="mailto:sbrindle@netcom.com">Ethereal Dragon</a>, one of the members
                        from the Prodigy club. A number of the folks in the club were also in the
                        old one. If you're looking for someone, check the roster and failing that,
                        feel free to ask.</p>

                        <p>7) Once again, welcome back. :)</p>

                    This FAQ contains information about the Ultima Dragons - Internet Chapter, an on-line club for and about Origin's Ultima series of computer role playing game. It also contains information about the alt.games.ultima.dragons newsgroup, as well as sources
                    of Ultima-related information that can be found on the Internet. Technically, this FAQ is a guide and handbook for members of the Ultima Dragons, as well as a guide to netiquette on the alt.games.ultima.dragons newsgroup. There is no section of
                    actual questions and answers for the games themselves, as this document was not designed to provide actual help on the Ultima games except in a most general way. Besides, answering specific questions about the games in this FAQ would more or less
                    defeat the purpose of the Ultima Dragons. Therefore, a fair proportion of the questions are most likely devoted to answering queries about the Ultima Dragons' purpose, history, and the like, as well as that of the newsgroup.

                <h2><a name="i1_0">1.0 THE ULTIMA DRAGONS AND ULTIMA DRAGONS -
                INTERNET CHAPTER</a> </h2>

                <h3><a name="i1_1">1.1: What are the Ultima Dragons?</a> </h3>

                <p>The Ultima Dragons are a club, a virtual club to be exact. A virtual club is
                defined as a group of people sharing a common interest who are part of an
                organization that is based on a computer network. Many of the members may never meet
                each other, and it's this anonymity that makes these clubs so popular.</p>

                <p>The Ultima Dragons are composed of people around the world who share a common
                interest: Ultima. Though most of the members are, as of now, in the United States,
                there are members in Australia, Britain, Canada, Germany, and Singapore (to name but
                a few).</p>

                <p>The primary goal of the Ultima Dragons is to help other Ultima players with the
                games by providing assistance (plotwise or technical) to the Ultima gaming community
                at large. Along the same lines, a goal of the Ultima Dragons is to share experiences
                with and knowledge of the series with other players and Dragons-- which includes
                discussion, debate, hypothesizing, and the like.</p>

                <p>Just as important a goal of the Dragons is to promote socialization among its
                members. One of the most notable characteristics of the Ultima Dragons has always
                been the sense of family (however dysfunctional it may be).</p>

                <h3><a name="i1_2">1.2: Is there a difference between the plain Ultima Dragons and
                Ultima Dragons - Internet Chapter (UDIC)?</a> </h3>

                <p>Yes and no. &quot;Ultima Dragons&quot; alone refers to the entire club, both past
                and present, and everything related to it. &quot;Ultima Dragons - Internet
                Chapter&quot; refers specifically to the club that exists on the Internet, but since
                there really isn't an Ultima Dragons - Prodigy Chapter (so to speak) any more, the
                plain &quot;Ultima Dragons&quot; is usually used to refer to both. Also correct is
                the abbreviation UDIC, which stands for the longer name.</p>

                <p>The other difference is that the Internet version of the Dragons does not have
                the government or rank system that the Prodigy version had; this is but one of
                several such changes made to the club in the adaptation process.</p>

                <p>Why, then, is it still called UDIC, when it really isn't a chapter of anything?
                That's a very good, still-unanswered question. Probably, the reason it hasn't been
                changed yet is that we've gotten used to calling it that already.</p>

                <h3><a name="i1_3">1.3: What exactly do the Ultima Dragons do?</a>
                </h3>

                <p>The main goal of the Ultima Dragons is to render a service to the Ultima-playing
                Internet community. This service mostly pertains to assisting other players through
                tough spots in the games; but also covers the discussions and debates about fine
                points in the games themselves, whether it be talking of the plots of the games, or
                wondering why something happened the way it did instead of some other way, or even
                the technical aspects of the Ultima series. This was also the prime motivator of the
                Prodigy Dragons for most of that club's existence (not counting GVT debates). In
                terms of assistance, the idea is that the Dragons read through Ultima-related cries
                to help on the newsgroup comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.rpg and answer them to the best of
                their ability; although this is not specifically required, it is the general idea
                behind the club. Ultima questions posted to the alt.games.ultima.dragons newsgroup
                are also accepted.</p>

                <p>The other, and in many respects just as equally important, goal of the Ultima
                Dragons is to bring together and form bonds of friendship between people from around
                the world who share Ultima as a common interest. In this respect, conversations
                about things other than Ultima are very likely to occur and, in most respects,
                encouraged. This will be detailed more in the section below on
                alt.games.ultima.dragons netiquette.</p>

                <h3><a name="i1_4">1.4: How did UDIC come about?</a> </h3>

                <p>By September 1994, a very large number of Dragons had given up on <a
                href="http://www.prodigy.com/">Prodigy</a> and written the Prodigy Dragons off as a
                lost cause. That month, it was discovered that some Dragons had Internet email
                addresses, and knew someone that knew someone else's address, and so on... the
                upshot being that, in the space of roughly a week, about two dozen Dragons had been
                reunited from across the United States.</p>

                <p>Two of these Dragons, <a href="mailto:sbrindle@netcom.com">Ethereal Dragon</a>
                (Stephen Brindle) and <a href="mailto:dricket@netcom.com">Gold Dragon</a> (Doug
                Ricket, the creator of the original club), had been idly discussing the possibility
                of making an Internet version of the Dragons for quite some time. Ethereal was the
                one gracious enough to actually provide the utilities for it to become possible. The
                result was Ultima Dragons - Internet Chapter (at the time, the Prodigy club still
                existed, if only marginally). Ethereal was responsible for proposing and then
                creating the alt.games.ultima.dragons Usenet newsgroup, as well as the first Dragons
                FTP site.</p>

                <p>It must be noted that, shortly after the creation of UDIC, the original Prodigy
                club voted to abolish their governing body, and (save for a few die-hard Dragons)
                was allowed to die.</p>

                <h3><a name="i1_5">1.5: I would like to join the Dragons. How do I do this?</a>
                </h3>

                <p>If you can, fill out the WWW form. Its at: &lt;<a
                href="join.html">http://www.udic.org/join.html</a>&gt; It'll ask all the right
                questions and make sure its delivered to the proper place.</p>

                <p>If you can't access the WWW directly but you can telnet, then telnet to
                info.funet.fi and log in as www. You can use that to access the above URL.</p>

                <p>If you can't do any of this but you can send email then send email to <a
                href="mailto:join@udic.org">join@udic.org</a>. Include your chosen dragon name (__
                Dragon) your email address, your real name, which Ultimas you've played and anything
                else you feel like sending. This'll deliver it as well.</p>

                <p>Where does this actually get delivered? Well, right now either of these actions
                sends email to <a href="mailto:Rainbow_Dragon@udic.org">Rainbow Dragon</a> and <a
                href="http://www.dirtside.com/herrin/">Fallible Dragon</a>. Fallible picks out the
                finger and WWW home page information to update the web page. Rainbow checks your
                dragon name against the roster. If it doesn't conflict with anyone else, he adds it
                and forwards it on to one of several other dragons who send you a message saying
                &quot;hi, welcome to the club&quot;. If it does conflict, he lets you know and asks
                for you to send him a new name.</p>

                <p>The most basic membership information needed is that you must have played an
                Ultima enough to have some base of knowledge on it, and the willingness to help
                other people. The other requirement is that you need to pick a name in the format
                ________ Dragon, where the space can be just about anything you think sounds cool or
                fitting to your personality. For example, in the old club, there was a Rendell
                Dragon, a Lady Dragon, an Obsidian Dragon, a Whisper Dragon, and a Cathartic
                Bloodspree Dragon; in the new club, there are names like SwiftHeart, Ancient
                Balance, Parenthetical, and Seinentai Dragon. And just ask someone if they can
                join.</p>

                <p>You will be then given a copy of this FAQ for your very own (ooh), a little
                rundown on what the Dragons do (depending on the person giving it), and told to use
                the symbol -==(UDIC)==- underneath your Dragon name to denote membership. Some
                Dragons have taken to altering their .signature files in some way to advertise their
                membership; while not required, it's a neat thing to do. Look around on
                alt.games.ultima.dragons for some ideas. Then, just jump right in. :)</p>

                <h3><a name="i1_6">1.6: I know someone who used to be a Dragon
                long ago (or am someone who used to be a Dragon). How do I get
                them (or myself) in touch with the rest of the club?</a> </h3>

                <p>Just stop on by alt.games.ultima.dragons and say hello and reintroduce yourself
                and all that nice stuff. :) Also, email Rapier Dragon at turnerw@aspen.uml.edu and
                let him know you're back so he can add you to the memberlist.</p>

                <p>Failing this, email Ethereal Dragon at sbrindle@netcom.com and introduce yourself
                there, and see if he can't put you in touch with the rest of us. :)</p>

                <h3><a name="i1_7">1.7: Do you do anything else besides post to a.g.u.d?</a> </h3>

                <p>We read notes from a.g.u.d. :) But seriously. Other than the help and discussion
                aspects on both that newsgroup and comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.rpg, many Dragons like to
                converge on Undernet IRC to chat (see section 1.8).</p>

                <p>Many of us also tend to have Ultima-related hobbies in real life as well. A few
                of us write Ultima stories in our spare time (as a hobby). At least one Dragon has
                taken up playing Ultima songs on his mandolin.</p>

                <h3><a name="i1_8">1.8: What's this I hear about the Dragons' IRC
                chats?</a> </h3>

                <p>Many Dragons (the actual number varies from time to time) often flock to the
                Undernet IRC every night to hang out and talk and kill time, or to argue (wide grin
                to all the fellow IRCers). The channel is 'officially' (not as if it matters) open
                at 9:00 P.M. Eastern time Friday through Sunday on Undernet IRC channel
                <strong>#udic</strong>. However, in recent months there has been activity on every
                night of the week, generally starting at around 6:30 P.M. Eastern. These chats have
                a tendency to last well into the morning, until the participants leave out of sheer
                fatigue. On Prodigy, something similar used to occur; the participants would
                exchange email and public messages until the system closed for the night. This was
                known as 'Nighthawking.' It would appear that this tendency is inherent to all
                Dragons...</p>

                <p>To access the chat, one must have either an IRC client installed or access to
                one. If there is no client on your system, consider installing one. For users with
                UNIX-based systems with 2.5 megs free in their account, and the permission to do
                such, a self-compiling IRC client can be installed by typing the command: &quot;
                <samp>telnet sci.dixie.edu 1 | sh</samp>&quot; at the UNIX prompt.</p>

                <p>Once in IRC, you MUST switch your server to one on the Undernet system using the
                /server command. A list of Undernet servers follows:</p>

                <p>For those with no IRC client and no means to acquire one, it is possible to
                telnet to one of several public-access IRC clients. Note that these sites all have a

                enough). If one is full, simply connect to another one. If your system has identd

                <p>Note that it is CRUCIAL that you enter the port number. (Note that on a VAX
                system, the format for the command is telnet &lt;wherever&gt;
                /PORT=&lt;whatever&gt;) Once connected, the command /join #udic will take you to the

                <h2><a name="i2_0">2.0 ALT.GAMES.ULTIMA.DRAGONS INFORMATION AND
                NETIQUETTE</a> </h2>

                <h2><a name="i2_1">2.1:</a> What is <a
                href="news:alt.games.ultima.dragons">alt.games.ultima.dragons</a>? </h2>

                <p>This newsgroup is a forum created by and for Ultima fans to talk about their
                favorite game, as well as socialize and increase their own personal community of
                friends. Gamers seeking help with the games may also ask questions here with a
                fairly good chance of getting them answered (sometimes in ridiculous detail) within
                a very short time. Alt.games.ultima.dragons also serves as the &quot;home base&quot;
                of the Ultima Dragons - Internet Chapter, and the prime hangout of many of them.</p>

                <h3><a name="i2_2">2.2:</a> I'm not a Dragon. Can I participate here? </h3>

                <p>Sure! Just because the newsgroup name has the word Dragons in it doesn't
                necessarily mean we're exclusionist, or that anybody who posts there must join our
                club. The Dragons (who created the newsgroup) welcome anybody in the community of
                Ultima gamers to simply drop by and join an ongoing discussion or create a new
                thread, or just chat. In fact, non-member participation is encouraged in a.g.u.d
                (or, should be); the more Ultima fans there, the merrier, even if they aren't
                Dragons.</p>

                <h3><a name="i2_3">2.3:</a> Are there any Ultima celebrities here? </h3>

                <p>A definite yes. On the &quot;hey, that's neat!&quot; side, two Dragons have been
                lucky enough to have been featured in Ultima games over the years. Arbuthnot Dragon
                (William Jensen) was featured in _Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny_, as well as
                mentioned in the guidebook for _Ultima Underworld I: The Stygian Abyss_ as being the
                original bearer of the Ring of Humility. In a more visual appearance, Umbrae
                Dragon's (Jim Hammons) likeness was used in _Ultima VII Part Two: Serpent Isle_ as
                the face of Ensorcio, the mage in Sleeping Bull.</p>

                <p>On the &quot;wow, this is really cool!&quot; side, a small handful of current and
                ex-<a href="http://www.origin.ea.com/english/">ORIGIN</a> staff participate on
                alt.games.ultima.dragons from time to time. Brian Martin, who is on the design team
                for _Ultima IX_, used the group at one time for creative feedback in the creation of
                that game, and continues to monitor it for the opinions of the posters as to what
                constitutes the proverbial good Ultima game. Bill Armintrout, whose name should be
                familiar enough to any Ultima player who is in the habit of reading the credits for
                previous Ultima games, also participates from time to time; he no longer is involved
                with the production of Ultima, but is very knowledgeable on the making of and
                reasoning behind the making of several earlier Ultimas. Dr. Cat, who no longer works
                for ORIGIN but is a very familiar personage (especially if you have played _Ultima
                VI: The False Prophet_, also shows up from time to time. His current project is a
                graphical MUD known as <a
                href="http://www.realtime.net/~gauntlet/dspire.html">DragonSpires</a>, which he is
                working on along with several other former ORIGIN employees. The MUD is for PCs, and
                requires a special client that is available for FTP at <a
                href="ftp://ftp.eden.com/pub/dspire/">ftp://ftp.eden.com/pub/dspire/</a>. </p>

                <h3><a name="i2_4">2.4:</a> Are there any special posting rules on a.g.u.d? </h3>

                <p>This is the technical netiquette section of this FAQ. Agud follows the standard
                <a href="usenet.html">usenet nettiquette conventions</a>. Basically, there are some
                common sense ones, however; flame wars (while they have a nasty habit to spring up
                in any concentration of Ultima Dragons members) waste more energy and bandwidth than
                is necessary, and also has the incredibly efficient ability of proving the
                immaturity of the participants. So-called &quot;nasty language,&quot; while not
                precisely prohibited (this is, after all, an unmoderated newsgroup), is also
                somewhat unnecessary, as a few participants have young children who like to read
                this group as well. Generally, if it's not something you would say in a decent
                restaurant at a largish table with a group of your friends and some of their
                friends, don't say it here. If only to make it a pleasant place to hang out and
                converse.</p>

                <h3><a name="i2_5">2.5:</a> My news server doesn't get a.g.u.d. How can I
                participate? </h3>

                <p>This section pertains to those who can telnet but whose news boxes don't get
                a.g.u.d for whatever reason. If you have a WWW client, true, you can often access
                newsgroups that way, but usually the news URLs (in the format news:name.of.group)
                point the client to your local news machine, and if you don't get the group in the
                first place... you get the idea. It used to be true that one could telnet to
                library.wustl.edu and use the public Lynx browser there to read Usenet news,
                including the alt.games.ultima.dragons newsgroup; sadly, however, this is no longer
                the case.</p>

                <p>There is a definite workaround for posting -to- the newsgroup, however. It is
                slow sometimes, and somewhat unreliable from time to time, but is really better than
                nothing.</p>

                <ul> <li>Address an email to <a
                href="mailto:alt-games-ultima-dragons@cs.utexas.edu">alt-games-ultima-dragons@cs.utexas.edu</a>
                </li> <li>The subject line can be whatever subject you want; as can the body of the
                message itself.</li> </ul>

                <p>The email will go to a mail-to-news gateway, and hopefully show up in the
                newsgroup within a short amount of time.</p>

                <p>Another method, recommended for those also with telnet and willing to send mail
                to Cleveland, Ohio, USA, is the Cleveland Freenet. CFn allows reading and posting to
                Usenet newsgroups (over 6000 of them) from there. Email Monomolecular Dragon at <a
                href="mailto:Monomolecular_Dragon@udic.org">Monomolecular_Dragon@udic.org</a> for

                <h3><a name="i2_6">2.6:</a> These people aren't talking about Ultima all the time.
                Is this okay? </h3>

                <p>Well, since one of the other main missions of the Dragons (and therefore, the
                newsgroup) is the promotion of socialization and the
                &quot;getting-to-know-each-other&quot; bit, it's perfectly acceptable. Most people
                try to strike a fair balance between Ultima-related and non-Ultima-related posts,
                though, but discussions about topics as diverse (and odd) as spheres, Cinnabons, and
                Enya.</p>

                <p>(by Rak Dragon)</p>

                <p>And there [is] (supposed) to be more to this club than Ultima. If you just wanted
                a purely Ultima group, then go create comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.rpg.ultima. What I am
                trying to say that [sic]this group is a society. The fact that every post is not
                Ultima - related (or even the great majority) is not bad... This club goes beyond
                Ultima...</p>

                <h3><a name="i2_7">2.7:</a> Why are there so many weird people on here? </h3>

                <p>Back in ancient Sosaria, Mondain had a twin brother Bernie. Bernie's greatest
                accomplishment was the creation of the Gem of Spam which, when it was accidentally
                shattered by the Stranger (who was on his way to Mondain's Apartment o' Doom) really
                smelled and looked icky. But later, when Perrier was accidentally spilt on the
                squishy mess that had once been Spam but was now... well, bits of Spam... a utterly
                pointless and uninteresting yet obviously real machine known as the Bizarre-o-tron
                was born. This machine was somehow forced into the Ethereal Void, where it pumps out
                waves of weirdness all across the Sub-Etha, including the Internet. Hence, the weird
                people on alt.games.ultima.dragons.</p>

                <p>See? Actually, it seems that due to the diversity of views and hobbies of the
                Dragons (and other participants), everyone has some sort of bent world view that,
                when applied in the social context of the newsgroup, just makes things real nice and
                fun. A lot see this newsgroup as a way to unwind with friends; naturally, such
                situations tend to lead to frivolity and goofing off.</p>

                <h2><a name="i3_0">3.0 GENERAL INFORMATION ON ULTIMA</a> </h2>

                <h3><a name="i3_1">3.1:</a> What the heck is Ultima? </h3>

                <p>Ultima is the name of a tremendously successful series of computer role playing
                games by <a href="http://www.origin.ea.com/english/">ORIGIN</a>/<a
                href="http://www.ea.com/">Electronic Arts</a>. The series began in 1980 with the
                eponymous first game, conceived and written by <a
                href="http://www.origin.ea.com/english/#RG">Richard Garriot</a> and published by
                California Pacific. Since then, there have been twelve additional games in the
                series and two add-on disks. But then, if you're reading this FAQ, you must have
                -some- clue what Ultima is. :)</p>

                <h3><a name="i3_2">3.2:</a> Who makes Ultima? </h3>

                <p>Ultima is a product of <a href="http://www.origin.ea.com/english/">ORIGIN
                Systems, Inc.</a>, an <a href="http://www.origin.ea.com/english/">Electronic
                Arts</a> Company, based in Austin, Texas (USA). The series was created by <a
                href="http://www.origin.ea.com/english/#RG">Richard Garriot</a>        in 1980 with
                the release of the game &quot;<a
                href="http://www.owo.com/archive/ultima1/">Ultima</a>&quot; for the Apple computer
                by California Pacific. Because California Pacific went out of business in 1981,
                Sierra On-Line published &quot; <a href="http://www.owo.com/archive/ultima2/">Ultima ][:
                Revenge of the Enchantress</a>&quot; in 1982. Following the success of those two
                games, Richard, his brother Robert, his father Owen, and Chuck Bueche formed ORIGIN
                Systems, Inc. in 1983. Following the release of &quot;<a
                href="http://www.owo.com/archive/ultima6/">Ultima VI: The False Prophet</a>&quot; in
                1990, ORIGIN became affiliated with Electronic Arts; however, <a
                href="http://www.origin.ea.com/english/#RG">Richard Garriot</a> remains the chief
                evil genius behind the Ultima line. ORIGIN is also responsible for the tremendously
                successful &quot;Wing Commander&quot; series.</p>

                <h3><a name="i3_3">3.3:</a> What's the general storyline? </h3>

                <p>In the first <a href="http://www.owo.com/archive/ultima1/">Ultima</a>, you had to
                stop the evil wizard Mondain from completely overrunning the four continents of the
                planet Sosaria and end his reign of terror. In the <a
                href="http://www.owo.com/archive/ultima2/">sequel</a>, you had to travel through
                several periods of time to find Mondain's child bride and prodigy Minax and undo the
                destruction she did to Earth. <a href="http://www.owo.com/archive/ultima3/">Ultima
                ]I[: Exodus</a> takes place on Sosaria again. This time, you and a party of
                adventurers must find and defeat Exodus, Mondain and Minax's offspring, and restore
                peace to Sosaria. These first three games are often referred to as the <a
                href="http://www.owo.com/archive/trilogy1.html">First Trilogy</a>, or the <a
                href="http://www.owo.com/archive/trilogy1.html">Triad of Evil</a>.</p>

                <p>In <a href="http://www.owo.com/archive/ultima4/">Ultima IV: Quest of the
                Avatar</a>, Lord British has united Sosaria, which changes it's name to Britannia in
                celebration. You are called back at the behest of Lord British to recover the Codex
                of Ultimate Wisdom, and in doing so become the Avatar, the embodiment of Virtue, as
                well as Britannia's moral role model. In <a
                href="http://www.owo.com/archive/ultima5/">Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny</a>, Lord
                British has been captured and a tyrant has assumed the throne. You must defeat the
                true evil behind Lord Blackthorn, rescue Lord British, and return him to his
                rightful throne. In <a href="http://www.owo.com/archive/ultima6/">Ultima VI: The
                False Prophet</a>, Britannia has been overrun by Gargoyles, who have captured the
                Shrines of the Virtues. You, as the Avatar, must discover the reason behind the
                attacks and put an end to them. These three games are sometimes referred to as the
                <a href="http://www.owo.com/archive/trilogy2.html">Second Trilogy </a>.</p>

                <p><a href="http://www.owo.com/archive/ultima7/">Ultima VII: The Black Gate</a>
                takes place 200 years after Ultima VI. Mysterious murders have been happening in
                Britannia, and a new organization, The Fellowship, seems to be at fault. Plus, the
                Avatar must solve the mystery of the Guardian, a mystery that could destroy
                Britannia. The add-on disk for Ultima VII, Forge of Virtue, sends the Avatar on a
                quest to the Isle of Fire to learn the meaning of Truth, Love, and Courage, the
                three great Principles of Britannia. The story continues in <a
                href="http://www.owo.com/archive/ultima72/">Ultima VII Part Two: Serpent Isle</a>, a
                stand-alone game that finds the Avatar and company sent to a mythical lost country
                to track down Batlin, the head of The Fellowship, and also discover the Guardian's
                plans. In the process, the Avatar must unlock the secrets of that land and restore
                Balance to it. An add-on disk for U7-2, Silver Seed, sends the Avatar back in time
                to the middle of the war between the armies of Chaos and Order. Like Forge of
                Virtue, this add-on disk builds the Avatar's stats up and gives him really nifty
                items.</p>

                <p>Indirectly, this story continues in <a
                href="http://www.owo.com/archive/ultima8/">Ultima VIII: Pagan</a>, the most recent
                installment of Ultima. The Guardian has deposited the Avatar alone on a dying world
                dominated by four great Titans. Against all cost, the Avatar must defeat the Titans
                and escape Pagan to stop the Guardian's plan to take over Britannia.</p>

                <p>These eight games form the core storyline of Ultima. There are, however, four
                other games in the line. The first two were produced by LookingGlass Technologies,
                and feature a virtual-reality type interface. The first of these, <a
                href="http://www.owo.com/archive/uw1/">Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss</a>,
                sends the Avatar deep into the heart of a volcano to rescue a princess and stop an
                evil mage. The second one takes place between U7-1 and U7-2. In <a
                href="http://www.owo.com/archive/uw2/">Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of
                Worlds</a>, the Guardian has encased Castle British in a mysterious Blackrock gem,
                and it is up to the Avatar to travel deep underground in search of a way to destroy
                it. The other two Ultimas are the &quot;<a
                href="http://www.owo.com/archive/wou.html">Worlds of Ultima</a>&quot; series,
                consisting of <a href="http://www.owo.com/archive/savage/">Worlds of Ultima: Savage
                Empire</a> and <a href="http://www.owo.com/archive/martian/">Worlds of Ultima:
                Martian Dreams</a>. These games are separate from the Sosaria/Britannia stories.</p>

                <p>(by Fire Dragon)</p>

                <p><a href="http://www.owo.com/archive/savage/">Savage Empire</a>: The Avatar went
                to the lab of his friend, who just happens to be a scientist. Anyway, something
                happens, and they get blown back in time/space, to a place where all sorts of
                dinosaurs &amp; pre-historic men lived. The A's goal is to make it back to his home
                time/place.</p>

                <p><a href="http://www.owo.com/archive/martian/">Martian Dreams</a>: The big A goes
                back in time at the request of a woman. He ends up in the 19th century, and gets
                rocketed to Mars to rescue an expedition. He discovers these things called
                &quot;dream machines&quot;, where Martians have decided to stay for their own
                safety, due to pestilence that the foul Raxachk (I think that's his name) has
                unleashed on Mars. You also have to free major players of the Victorian era (Nellie
                Bly, Mark Twain, Louis Tiffany, etc. etc.).</p>

                <h3><a name="i3_4">3.4:</a> Where can I get an Ultima game? </h3>

                <p>Your local software retailer would be your best bet for the most recent Ultima
                release (as well as other fine ORIGIN titles). ORIGIN has also released a CD-ROM
                containing Ultimas I-VI, a CD-ROM containing the complete Ultima VII, and an Ultima
                VIII CD-ROM collection. In addition, one of the Ultima Underworlds is available on
                CD-ROM bundled with Wing Commander II: Vengeance of the Kilrathi. Usually, these
                CD-ROMs exist as delivery material only; that is, the software must still be
                installed to the hard drive before playing. These titles may also be ordered direct
                from ORIGIN. All games are IBM compatible only; even though the original games were
                on the Apple, there are no games currently for the Macintosh (and no immediate plans
                for any, either). The general price range for these games is between $30 and $50 US,
                although some have reported seeing Ultima VIII for a low as $12. There are also
                Nintendo and Super Nintendo editions of Ultima, as well as the Game Boy Ultima:
                Runes of Virtue. General consensus in the Ultima community is that the computer
                versions are overall much better, however.</p>

                <p>The most recent edition of the old FAQ was dated November 28, 1994. For all
                purposes and intents that old FAQ is being considered the Version 1.0 FAQ, even if
                it had suffered whatever updates (there was at least one to it). The first edition
                of the new FAQ is numbered Version 2.0, and this sequence will hopefully be followed
                for as long as someone is doing the FAQ. As expected, the number after the decimal
                will be increased with each minor revision or correction or contribution (but -not-
                with each posting) and the number before the decimal will change with each major new
                release; i.e., with a new section, or completely rewritten section, or change in
                format, or whatever.</p>

                <p>For reference, this FAQ was generally patterned after Michael Wang's
                &quot;Internet PC Games FAQ;&quot; the general format was used in the writing of
                Version 2.0 of this document because Barry really has no clue how a FAQ should be
                organized.</p>

                <p>Version 2.0 was finished on December 30, 1994, and released on the same day.
                <br>Version 2.1 was finished on January 13, 1995 but never posted. <br>Version 2.11
                was a last-minute on-Line revision of V2.1, done on January 15, 1995, shortly before
                posting to alt.games.ultima.dragons. <br>Version 3.0 was a complete redraft and
                reorganization, finished on February 13, 1995, and posted the same day. <br>Version
                3.1 was converted to HTML and updated by Fallible Dragon on May 1, 1995.</p>

                <h3><a name="i5_3">5.3:</a> Odd Dragon Things (originally by Ethereal Dragon,
                revised by Monomolecular Dragon) </h3>

                <p>This lingo is rather foreign to most members of the net, and rightfully so: it is
                personal and obsolete. The newer, hipper crowd of Dragons will probably not use
                these sayings, but you may catch a few old timers spitting them out like they were
                tiny seeds harvested in rich soil, warmed by the nurturing sun and cool spring
                rains, blossoming into beautiful trees...Well, enough of that poetic crap. Let's cut
                to the chase.</p>

                <p>- NMPR <br>No more public replies. The software on Prodigy would blast you with
                this not very friendly message if you tried to post publicly to a note that was
                scheduled for deletion, whatever the reason may have been. When starting a new note
                but staying on the same topic, Dragons would prefix the note with the line,
                &quot;Damn! I got NMPRed! Anyway, as I was saying...&quot;, or something to that
                effect.</p>

                <p>- JP <br>Junk post. A junk post is defined as a useless waste of net bandwidth
                that serves no purpose. They can be pretty fun, actually. JPs come in many
                varieties: ramblings, meaningless lists, and just plain silly.</p>

                <p>- Anadaking <br>I admit, I made this one up on my own. But don't you agree that
                it should be a part of our extended Dragon vocabulary? Anyway, Anadak Dragon, once
                in a fit of boredom from being home sick from school as well as being frustrated
                that he had not been promoted, posted over a hundred short and pointless notes in
                under half an hour. The notes were incredibly wasteful of bandwidth and cluttered up
                the subjects for many hours thereafter, and at that time Prodigy had not yet
                implemented twit lists. So, Anadaking (or any variant thereof) is posting a large
                number of unnecessary notes with no content.</p>

                <p>- :*, B), &amp;, etc. <br>Many Dragons had ASCII symbols that, over the months
                (or maybe years), had become instantly associated with them. :* was Whisper's kiss,
                as she has a certain fondness of putting kisses in her messages. B) was Sun's
                symbol; sunglasses, natch. The &amp; is Umbrae's symbol, and I have no clue what
                -that- is supposed to represent...</p>

                <p>- G@C, GC, GVT <br>All three of these acronyms are shorthand for the Grand
                Council, but GVT encompasses the Grand Council and all the circle leaders and honor
                circle members. Since we have no circle system anymore, it is useless to explain it
                in this FAQ. If you really want to know, ask one of the old Dragons.</p>

                <p>- Any strange 2 or 3 letter word that is used when referring to another member
                <br>It's tiresome to write out Dragon names again and again, especially when you are
                referring to Monomolecular Dragon or Demented Cheez Wiz Dragon. Therefore, nicknames
                are quickly developed. Some examples include Beo (for Beowolf), Chammy (for
                Chameleon), DV (for Dark Vengeance), Eth (for Ethereal), Mono (for Monomolecular),
                etc. And then, of course, there are nicknames that are just as long as the regular
                names, but slightly less formal, like Whispie (for Whisper). Share your nickname
                with the Dragon crowd. </p>

                <p>- UG/Lair (by Fire Dragon) <br>&quot;UnderGround&quot;, which was a way to
                circumvent *P* board access times &amp; E-mail costs. The originator would set aside
                a spare ID I.E. MVJP37A would open up MVJP37D for use (MVJP37B being my original
                ID... oh, how long ago, when that shit network was worth something.) by himself and
                several other people. He would give the ID &amp; p-word, and several users would use
                the account. Instead of sending an e-mail to an actual ID, in the &quot;TO:&quot;
                field, one would put &quot;Hey, Cathartic,&quot;, and write 6 pages of their
                message. *P* then flagged the term UG from then on...</p>

                <p>[These became known as Lairs after Prodigy started deleting -any- message
                containing the letters U and G next to each other. A -lot- of things happened on
                these lairs.]</p>

                <p>- OBD <br>Operation Blue Duck, a conspiracy that it just too complicated to
                explain in short order. Maybe we'll get one of the members to write a complete
                thesis on it which we can store at the FTP site. </p>

                <p>- Skyblade's Wet Noodle Of Death
                    <br>Um... this is a product of Skyblade Dragon, plain and simple...</p>

                <h3><a name="i5_4">5.4:</a> A Brief Chronology of the Ultima Dragons </h3>

                <p>I tried to be more or less accurate with this. Any mistakes included are due
                simply to the sketchiness level of the notes I was working off of. In keeping this
                list as brief as possible, many crucial events seem to have been downplayed or
                ignored. This, however, is intended to be only a general overview of the history of
                the Dragons. I am, theoretically, working on a longer history file which will cover
                these events in as much detail as my notes allow.</p>

                <p>
                    <strong>1990 - Prehistory (before anything cool was happening)</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>1991 - First Era(the birth of Ultima clubs)</strong>
                </p>

                <p>- Evil Avatars (EAs) and Guppes (Good Ultima Players Pounding Evil Slime, by some
                accounts) formed on Prodigy (founders and date uncertain)</p>

                <p>- Guppes change name to PVLBs (Protectors of Virtue and Lord British)</p>

                <p>- &quot;Operation Morleycide:&quot; Personal conflict between two EAs leads to
                one (Morley) creating Warriors of Tyranny. The EAs flame WOT into submission.</p>

                <p> <strong>1992 - Second Era (the creation and growth of the Ultima
                Dragons)</strong> </p>

                <p>- Prodigy revamps bulletin boards, loosening restrictions on posting</p>

                <p>- Knights of Anarchy founded by Vargo (friend of Morley). EAs begin similar
                actions as Operation Morleycide.</p>

                <p>- Players of Ultima For Fun (PUFF) formed by Doug Ricket (February 27, 1992)</p>

                <p>- Following a taunt by Scorpion (an EA, the phrase was &quot;PUFF the Magic
                Dragon&quot;), Doug Ricket renames PUFF to Ultima Dragons.</p>

                <p>- Gold Dragon (Ricket) invents Dragon government system (the Grand Council).</p>

                <p>- Dragon member roster begins building to the total 200-300 members it would
                eventually have at one point.</p>

                <p>- After being personally hurt by miscommunication, Copper Dragon begins creation
                of various Dragon policies and ranks with the end result of him having access to and
                some control of the Dragon GVT for long stretches at a time.</p>

                <p>- &quot;United Clubs of Ultima:&quot; proposed by a group of Dragons and EAs to
                unite the various Ultima clubs on Prodigy into one unit. Did not pass in EA voting,
                passed in Dragons. Later learned the vote was rigged *pro* UCU in the Eas.</p>

                <p>- Copper Dragon continues revenge against current Grand Council. Eventually, his
                membership is suspended.</p>

                <p>- Evil Avatars and PVLBs begin to fade from the political limelight.</p>

                <p>- &quot;Aaron:&quot; Aaron forms clubs with names similar to the other clubs.
                Several Dragons band together and harass him for this. Aaron retaliates by
                initiating a flame war. He would revive his grudge at frequent intervals over the
                next two years, including one (so far) stint in UDIC.</p>

                <p>- &quot;The Exodus:&quot; The entire Dragon Grand Council abdicates, leaving
                power vacuum. Several Dragons elect themselves to fill the space and try to rebuild
                the club. Rules of operation (the &quot;Tomb&quot;) codified.</p>

                <p>
                    <strong>1993 - Third Era (the Dragons' dominance and inner corruption).
                    </strong>
                </p>

                <p>- &quot;Sylvan's Snowball Fight:&quot; Turmoil of the Exodus and GVT rebuild
                continues. Sylvan Dragon starts a virtual 'snowball fight' as a (rather successful,
                if only briefly) diversion.</p>

                <p>- &quot;Matrix:&quot; more of the same flame wars that became in Dragon vogue. I
                don't remember much of this one, actually.</p>

                <p>- &quot;Chammy's Convention:&quot; During a Dragon convention at Chameleon
                Dragon's house, someone posts notes harassing Whisper Dragon. End result is further
                instability in the GVT, including the impeachment of Spectacle Dragon and the
                eventual resignation of Aiel Dragon.</p>

                <p>- Prodigy, in an attempt to recover from losses, raises prices. This forces a
                large number of old-core Dragons to leave.</p>

                <p>- &quot;Operation Blue Duck:&quot; Copper Dragon, still holding to his grudge,
                enlists Dark Vengeance to try to cause major political change in the Dragons. Dark
                Vengeance brings in several other dragons, with his own agenda being the political
                and emotional humiliation of Whisper Dragon. Copper backs out and tells Whisper.
                Using this information, the Grand Council, over the space of a week, gathers enough
                evidence of the conspiracy to force it public. The aftershocks keep things pretty
                ugly for most of the rest of the Prodigy Dragons' existence.</p>

                <p>- Storm Dragon attempts to create Ultima Dragons - Florida Chapter. This does not
                go over well with certain other Dragons, due to Storm's involvement in Blue
                Duck.</p>

                <p>- Also in 1993 there were several virtual Dragon marriages: Rendell Dragon to
                Iridescent Dragon; Lady Dragon to Aiel Dragon; Sylvan Dragon to Ebony Dragon; and
                Grignard Dragon to Whisper Dragon.</p>

                <p> <strong>1994 - Fourth Era (The fall of the Prodigy Dragons and the birth of
                UDIC)</strong> </p>

                <p>- Dragons member roster falls to roughly a dozen members, many without direct
                Prodigy access.</p>

                <p>- Many Dragons begin discovering that they all have some form of Internet access.
                Within the space of a couple of weeks 24 Dragons are reunited.</p>

                <p>- Ultima Dragons - Internet Chapter formed by Stephen Brindle and Doug Ricket
                (August 1994)</p>

                <p>- Prodigy Dragons finally vote to abolish government, effectively marking the
                death of that club.</p>

                <p>- Decision made to have UDIC remain government-free.</p>

                <p>- USENET newsgroup <a
                href="news:alt.games.ultima.dragons">alt.games.ultima.dragons</a> created to
                continue the original tradition of the old club, that of helping Ultima players.
                First international members. Member roster, counting infrequent posters, jumps to
                60+ members in the space of a week.</p>

                <p>- ORIGIN design team representatives suddenly and wonderfully appear in the
                newsgroup.</p>

                <p>- Aaron returns...</p>

                <p>
                    <strong>1995 - Fifth Era (continued expansion of UDIC ???)</strong>
                </p>

                <p>- Another virtual Dragon marriage, between Monomolecular Dragon and his RL
                girlfriend Kitten (Kittydwagon).</p>

                <p>- Greeting team formed by Fallible Dragon to welcome new members and manage the
                member roster (May 1995).</p>

                <h3>5.5: Why do older Dragons despise Prodigy? </h3>

                <p>The Ultima Dragons used to exist completely on Prodigy, between its inception in
                early 1992 and early Fall 1994. Before July 1993, Prodigy's price schedule was such
                that clubs like the Dragons were possible. When Prodigy decided to raise prices and
                adopt an hourly charge for bulletin board usage in July 1993 (much to the outraged
                protest of the board users), it became financially difficult for many members to
                participate, and the membership practically halved overnight. Those that could stay
                did so only with great difficulty.</p>

                <p>Many older Dragons (that is, pre-UDIC Dragons) are still angry at Prodigy because
                so many good Dragons (and friends) were lost at that time. With such a sense of
                family that the Dragons had (and have), the event was akin to losing a close friend
                or loved one. There are other reasons for the hatred, but this is the main one.</p>

                <h3><a name="i5_6">5.6:</a> What was the Ultima Dragons like before coming to the
                Internet? </h3>

                <p>The clearest definition that anyone can hope to use to describe the Prodigy club
                is that of a dysfunctional family full of sibling rivalry. It rivaled even some TV
                soap operas in terms of viciousness and inter-personal conflict. This mood was a
                result of the combination of members leaving due to price hikes, a series of
                problems with mismanagement, real life problems, and the general bitter attitude
                most Prodigy clubs had (or have). If one were to talk to an old member and ask about
                government intrigue, conspiracies, and bashing, the response would most likely be
                angered and full of bitterness at the memories.</p>

                <p>Paradoxically, however, the Prodigy Dragons were still a family, or at the very
                least mostly a tightly-knit group of friends. Dragon Conventions were held every so
                often in various locations. These rather fun events allowed members to meet each
                other face to face, get to know each other better, and raid each other's
                refrigerators. In fact, the bonds of friendship that formed were often so strong
                that at least four Dragons, two couples, fell in love and were married in real life.
                Just as paradoxically, many an old Dragon is likely to speak of the fun times in
                Vinnie's Pizza or the Drunken Stupor (pub-type things on Prodigy created by a few of
                the dominant Ultima clubs), or of diving from a sailboat at a Convention, or reading
                the notes that just made us laugh.</p>

                <p>Many members of the time, though, will describe the Prodigy Dragons in only two
                words: sheer hell.</p>

                <h3><a name="i5_7">5.7:</a> What is GVT and why are so many people talking about it?
                </h3>

                <p>GVT is shorthand for government, and refers to the system the Prodigy Dragons
                used to keep track of members and such. On Prodigy, it was not uncommon for clubs
                like the Dragons to have a form of government, with ranks and stuff like that. The
                system worked fairly well for a while, but was rife with scandal and crises and
                insult and vendetta and grudge, and affected many of the members in a very negative
                manner. Many Dragons quit because of or due to their experiences with the GVT; the
                majority of Dragons who survived the GVT scandals and pessimism to form UDIC still
                loathe the concept of having another GVT system. Luckily for it, the Prodigy Dragons
                officially abolished their GVT in a unanimous vote in September 1994, but since
                there were only a literal handful of members still there, it wasn't as difficult as
                it had been in the past.</p>

                <p>The anti-GVT sentiment is echoed by a lot of newer members who, although had
                never born witness to the perpetual headache that was the GVT, have been long- time
                Internet citizens and naturally tend to be aversive to governing systems in
                general.</p>

                <p>The reason it is still such a hot topic is a debate between those that see a need
                for a committee of some sort to oversee the mundane aspects of the club (the member
                list, processing new members, FTP site and FAQ maintenance, etc.) and those that
                are, for whatever reason, opposed to such a system for any reason.</p>

                <h3><a name="i5_8">5.8:</a> What are all the odd things people keep mentioning from
                time to time? </h3>

                <p>This will quite likely take some time, so feel free to skip on through unless
                you're real interested. Only some of the most talked about stuff is mentioned
                here.</p>

                <p>It has been mentioned that, in addition to Ultima help, politics also played a
                large role in the Dragons (and indeed, in the other Ultima clubs on Prodigy). In
                mid- to late-1992, there was a proposal called UCU, which was short for United Clubs
                of Ultima. It would unify all the Ultima clubs on Prodigy into one single unit. The
                two big players in UCU were the Dragons and the Evil Avatars (an interesting story
                in themselves). Operating behind the scenes was a group of people who were
                conspiring to rig the vote in favor of passage of UCU. Initially, in the Dragons,
                the Grand Council (the government) was against UCU, but when it came time to vote,
                it passed. In the Evil Avatars, the Triumvirate (the EA government) and EA members
                voted and rejected the UCU plan. It was discovered some time later that there was a
                group of both Eas and Dragons who had attempted to rig the vote, and that this group
                had gained uninvited access to the private conversation rooms of the respective club
                governments.</p>

                <p>After news of this conspiracy broke, a chain of events was set in on both sides
                that would lead to, in November 1992, the entire Ultima Dragons Grand Council
                simultaneously stepping down and leaving to form their own club, Township. Aiel
                Dragon, Gremlin Dragon, and several others rushed to fill the sudden power vacuum
                and attempt to rebuild what had suddenly shattered. This event was known as the
                Exodus, and is widely regarded as one of the causes of the Prodigy Dragons' eventual
                destruction: after it, no clear decisions on how to rebuild the Dragons could be
                made, and the subsequent flame wars weakened both the Dragons and the members
                therein.</p>

                <p>Operation Blue Duck represents the government idiocy taken to an extreme, and
                happens at the other end of the timeline from UCU and the Exodus (and, incidentally,
                can be shown to be a result of both). Very briefly, a group of Dragons and a
                non-Dragon tried to rig a Grand Council election in September 1993, to prevent
                Whisper Dragon (Tina Haumersen, who had long been a favored target, and unfairly so,
                of several Dragons for flamage) from gaining the open seat and, hopefully, to have
                her kicked out from the Dragons entirely. In response, the Grand Council and several
                other Dragons government members planned and executed Operation Blue Duck (the name
                is just one of those odd things) to forestall this coup. The conspirators were
                revealed and, were it not for the fact that the Prodigy Dragons were already on a
                terminal downslide at this point in time, everybody lived more or less dysfunctional
                ever after. (More information can be obtained from the author of this FAQ by email,
                as Monomolecular Dragon was the one who planned Blue Duck to begin with and is more
                or less the definitive source on what happened.)</p>

                <h3><a name="i5_9">5.9:</a> General policies of the Ultima Dragons (by Ethereal
                Dragon) </h3>

                <p>Due to the absence of a government, these rules can not be stressed. They have
                bled over from our Prodigy days, where they were sort of the golden rules of the
                club. A constitution was written there, but it has not been, and probably won't be,
                enacted in UDIC.</p>

                <p>These moral standards were practically forced on us, to be exact. Prodigy had
                (has?) a very strict policy of what you could and could not post. So, all the
                members of the club had to get into the habit of not swearing and not bashing other
                people. Along with that, proper netiquette, which you should be following anyway, is
                pretty much the basis for these morals.</p>

                <p>- In order to join the club, a person must have played (not completed) at least 1
                Ultima on any platform.</p>

                <p>- When talking with other members, and especially when posting notes in the
                newsgroup, stay away from &quot;heavy&quot; topics like abortion, religion, etc. At
                least, you CAN, but just do it via e-mail. And don't come whining if you completely
                destroy your friendship with that Dragon.</p>

                <p>- Respect ALL members of the club, regardless of the real life lives they
                lead.</p>

                <p>- Try to answer peoples' Ultima questions in comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.rpg. Even
                answering one question a week is better than answering none at all.</p>

                <p>- Your level of participation in the club is a personal decision, but you will
                generally be more liked and you will like the club more if you post in our
                newsgroup, help others with their Ultima queries, send any interesting Ultima
                related files you think should be up on the FTP site to Ethereal Dragon, and try to
                come to at least ONE IRC chat party. [See Section 1.8 for more information on the
                IRC chats.]</p>

                <p>- Most importantly, HAVE FUN!</p>

                <h2 align="center">A Primer on How to Work With the Usenet
                Community </h2>

                <p align="center">Chuq Von Rospach </p>

                <p>*** This message describes the Usenet culture and customs that
                have developed over time. Other documents in this newsgroup
                describe what Usenet is and manuals or on-line help on your
                system should provide detailed technical documentation. All new
                users should read this message to acclimate themselves to Usenet.
                (Old users could read it, too, to refresh their memories.) *** </p>

                <p>It is the people participating in Usenet that make it worth
                the effort to read and maintain; for Usenet to function properly
                those people must be able to interact in productive ways. This
                document is intended as a guide to using the net in ways that
                will be pleasant and productive for everyone. </p>

                <p>This document is not intended to teach you how to use Usenet.
                Instead, it is a guide to using it politely, effectively and
                efficiently. Communication by computer is new to almost
                everybody, and there are certain aspects that can make it a
                frustrating experience until you get used to them. This document
                should help you avoid the worst traps. </p>

                <p>The easiest way to learn how to use Usenet is to watch how
                others use it. Start reading the news and try to figure out what
                people are doing and why. After a couple of weeks you will start
                understanding why certain things are done and what things
                shouldn't be done. There are documents available describing the
                technical details of how to use the software. These are different
                depending on which programs you use to access the news. You can
                get copies of these from your system administrator. If you do not
                know who that person is, they can be contacted on most systems by
                mailing to account &quot;news&quot;, &quot;usenet&quot; or
                &quot;postmaster&quot;. </p>

                <p><strong>Never Forget that the Person on the Other Side is
                Human. </strong></p>

                <p>Because your interaction with the network is through a
                computer it is easy to forget that there are people &quot;out
                there.&quot; Situations arise where emotions erupt into a verbal
                free-for-all that can lead to hurt feelings. </p>

                <p>Please remember that people all over the world are reading
                your words. Do not attack people if you cannot persuade them with
                your presentation of the facts. Screaming, cursing, and abusing
                others only serves to make people think less of you and less
                willing to help you when you need it. </p>

                <p>If you are upset at something or someone, wait until you have
                had a chance to calm down and think about it. A cup of (decaf!)
                coffee or a good night's sleep works wonders on your perspective.
                Hasty words create more problems than they solve. Try not to say
                anything to others you would not say to them in person in a room
                full of people. </p>

                <p><strong>Don't Blame System Admins for their Users' Behavior.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>Sometimes, you may find it necessary to write to a system
                administrator about something concerning his or her site. Maybe
                it is a case of the software not working, or a control message
                escaped, or maybe one of the users at that site has done
                something you feel requires comment. No matter how steamed you
                may be, be polite to the sysadmin -- he or she may not have any
                idea of what you are going to say, and may not have any part in
                the incidents involved. By being civil and temperate, you are
                more likely to obtain their courteous attention and assistance. </p>

                <p><strong>Never assume that a person is speaking for their
                organization. </strong></p>

                <p>Many people who post to Usenet do so from machines at their
                office or school. Despite that, never assume that the person is
                speaking for the organization that they are posting their
                articles from (unless the person explicitly says so). Some people
                put explicit disclaimers to this effect in their messages, but
                this is a good general rule. If you find an article offensive,
                consider taking it up with the person directly, or ignoring it.
                Learn about &quot;kill files&quot; in your newsreader, and other
                techniques for ignoring people whose postings you find offensive.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Be Careful What You Say About Others.</strong> </p>

                <p>Please remember -- you read netnews; so do as many as
                3,000,000 other people. This group quite possibly includes your
                boss, your friend's boss, your girl friend's brother's best
                friend and one of your father's beer buddies. Information posted
                on the net can come back to haunt you or the person you are
                talking about. </p>

                <p>Think twice before you post personal information about
                yourself or others. This applies especially strongly to groups
                like soc.singles and alt.sex but even postings in groups like
                talk.politics.misc have included information about the personal
                life of third parties that could get them into serious trouble if
                it got into the wrong hands. </p>

                <p><strong>Be Brief.</strong> </p>

                <p>Never say in ten words what you can say in fewer. Say it
                succinctly and it will have a greater impact. Remember that the
                longer you make your article, the fewer people will bother to
                read it. </p>

                <p><strong>Your Postings Reflect Upon You -- Be Proud of Them. </strong></p>

                <p>Most people on Usenet will know you only by what you say and
                how well you say it. They may someday be your co-workers or
                friends. Take some time to make sure each posting is something
                that will not embarrass you later. </p>

                <p>Minimize your spelling errors and make sure that the article
                is easy to read and understand. Writing is an art and to do it
                well requires practice. Since much of how people judge you on the
                net is based on your writing, such time is well spent. </p>

                <p><strong>Use Descriptive Titles. </strong></p>

                <p>The subject line of an article is there to enable a person
                with a limited amount of time to decide whether or not to read
                your article. Tell people what the article is about before they
                read it. A title like &quot;Car for Sale&quot; to rec.autos does
                not help as much as &quot;66 MG Midget for sale: Beaverton
                OR.&quot; Don't expect people to read your article to find out
                what it is about because many of them won't bother. Some sites
                truncate the length of the subject line to 40 characters so keep
                your subjects short and to the point. </p>

                <p><strong>Think About Your Audience. </strong></p>

                <p>When you post an article, think about the people you are
                trying to reach. Asking UNIX(*) questions on rec.autos will not
                reach as many of the people you want to reach as if you asked
                them on comp.unix.questions or comp.unix.internals. Try to get
                the most appropriate audience for your message, not the widest. </p>

                <p>It is considered bad form to post both to misc.misc,
                soc.net-people, or misc.wanted and to some other newsgroup. If it
                belongs in that other newsgroup, it does not belong in misc.misc,
                soc.net-people, or misc.wanted. </p>

                <p>If your message is of interest to a limited geographic area
                (apartments, car sales, meetings, concerts, etc...), restrict the
                distribution of the message to your local area. Some areas have
                special newsgroups with geographical limitations, and the recent
                versions of the news software allow you to limit the distribution
                of material sent to world-wide newsgroups. Check with your system
                administrator to see what newsgroups are available and how to use
                them. </p>

                <p>If you want to try a test of something, do not use a
                world-wide newsgroup! Messages in misc.misc that say &quot;This
                is a test&quot; are likely to cause large numbers of caustic
                messages to flow into your mailbox. There are newsgroups that are
                local to your computer or area that should be used. Your system
                administrator can tell you what they are. </p>

                <p>Be familiar with the group you are posting to before you post!
                You shouldn't post to groups you do not read, or post to groups
                you've only read a few articles from -- you may not be familiar
                with the on-going conventions and themes of the group. One
                normally does not join a conversation by just walking up and
                talking. Instead, you listen first and then join in if you have
                something pertinent to contribute. </p>

                <p><strong>Be Careful with Humor and Sarcasm.</strong> </p>

                <p>Without the voice inflections and body language of personal
                communications, it is easy for a remark meant to be funny to be
                misinterpreted. Subtle humor tends to get lost, so take steps to
                make sure that people realize you are trying to be funny. The net
                has developed a symbol called the smiley face. It looks like
                &quot;:-)&quot; and points out sections of articles with humorous
                intent. No matter how broad the humor or satire, it is safer to
                remind people that you are being funny. But also be aware that
                quite frequently satire is posted without any explicit
                indications. If an article outrages you strongly, you should ask
                yourself if it just may have been unmarked satire. Several
                self-proclaimed connoisseurs refuse to use smiley faces, so take
                heed or you may make a temporary fool of yourself. </p>

                <p><strong>Only Post a Message Once.</strong> </p>

                <p>Avoid posting messages to more than one newsgroup unless you
                are sure it is appropriate. If you do post to multiple
                newsgroups, do not post to each group separately. Instead,
                specify all the groups on a single copy of the message. This
                reduces network overhead and lets people who subscribe to more
                than one of those groups see the message once instead of having
                to wade through each copy. </p>

                <p><strong>Please Rotate Messages With Questionable Content.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>Certain newsgroups (such as rec.humor) have messages in them
                that may be offensive to some people. To make sure that these
                messages are not read unless they are explicitly requested, these
                messages should be encrypted. The standard encryption method is
                to rotate each letter by thirteen characters so that an
                &quot;a&quot; becomes an &quot;n&quot;. This is known on the
                network as &quot;rot13&quot; and when you rotate a message the
                word &quot;rot13&quot; should be in the &quot;Subject:&quot;
                line. Most of the software used to read Usenet articles have some
                way of encrypting and decrypting messages. Your system
                administrator can tell you how the software on your system works,
                or you can use the Unix command </p>

                <p><samp>tr '[a-m][n-z][A-M][N-Z]' '[n-z][a-m][N-Z][A-M]'</samp> </p>

                <p>Don't forget the single quotes!) </p>

                <p><strong>Summarize What You are Following Up.</strong> </p>

                <p>When you are following up someone's article, please summarize
                the parts of the article to which you are responding. This allows
                readers to appreciate your comments rather than trying to
                remember what the original article said. It is also possible for
                your response to get to some sites before the original article. </p>

                <p>Summarization is best done by including appropriate quotes
                from the original article. Do not include the entire article
                since it will irritate the people who have already seen it. Even
                if you are responding to the entire article, summarize only the
                major points you are discussing. </p>

                <p><strong>When Summarizing, Summarize!</strong> </p>

                <p>When you request information from the network, it is common
                courtesy to report your findings so that others can benefit as
                well. The best way of doing this is to take all the responses
                that you received and edit them into a single article that is
                posted to the places where you originally posted your question.
                Take the time to strip headers, combine duplicate information,
                and write a short summary. Try to credit the information to the
                people that sent it to you, where possible. </p>

                <p><strong>Use Mail, Don't Post a Follow-up.</strong> </p>

                <p>One of the biggest problems we have on the network is that
                when someone asks a question, many people send out identical
                answers. When this happens, dozens of identical answers pour
                through the net. Mail your answer to the person and suggest that
                they summarize to the network. This way the net will only see a
                single copy of the answers, no matter how many people answer the
                question. </p>

                <p>If you post a question, please remind people to send you the
                answers by mail and at least offer to summarize them to the
                network. </p>

                <p><strong>Read All Follow-ups and Don't Repeat What Has Already
                Been Said.</strong> </p>

                <p>Before you submit a follow-up to a message, read the rest of
                the messages in the newsgroup to see whether someone has already
                said what you want to say. If someone has, don't repeat it. </p>

                <p><strong>Check the Headers When Following Up.</strong> </p>

                <p>The news software has provisions to specify that follow-ups to
                an article should go to a specific set of newsgroups -- possibly
                different from the newsgroups to which the original article was
                posted. Sometimes the groups chosen for follow-ups are totally
                inappropriate, especially as a thread of discussion changes with
                repeated postings. You should carefully check the groups and
                distributions given in the header and edit them as appropriate.
                If you change the groups named in the header, or if you direct
                follow-ups to a particular group, say so in the body of the
                message -- not everyone reads the headers of postings. </p>

                <p><strong>Be Careful About Copyrights and Licenses.</strong> </p>

                <p>Once something is posted onto the network, it is *probably* in
                the public domain unless you own the appropriate rights (most
                notably, if you wrote the thing yourself) and you post it with a
                valid copyright notice; a court would have to decide the
                specifics and there are arguments for both sides of the issue.
                Now that the US has ratified the Berne convention, the issue is
                even murkier (if you are a poster in the US). For all practical
                purposes, though, assume that you effectively give up the
                copyright if you don't put in a notice. Of course, the
                *information* becomes public, so you mustn't post trade secrets
                that way. </p>

                <p>When posting material to the network, keep in mind that
                material that is UNIX-related may be restricted by the license
                you or your company signed with AT&amp;T and be careful not to
                violate it. You should also be aware that posting movie reviews,
                song lyrics, or anything else published under a copyright could
                cause you, your company, or members of the net community to be
                held liable for damages, so we highly recommend caution in using
                this material. </p>

                <p><strong>Cite Appropriate References.</strong> </p>

                <p>If you are using facts to support a cause, state where they
                came from. Don't take someone else's ideas and use them as your
                own. You don't want someone pretending that your ideas are
                theirs; show them the same respect. </p>

                <p><strong>Mark or Rotate Answers and Spoilers.</strong> </p>

                <p>When you post something (like a movie review that discusses a
                detail of the plot) which might spoil a surprise for other
                people, please mark your message with a warning so that they can
                skip the message. Another alternative would be to use the
                &quot;rot13&quot; protocol to encrypt the message so it cannot be
                read accidentally. When you post a message with a spoiler in it
                make sure the word &quot;spoiler&quot; is part of the
                &quot;Subject:&quot; line. </p>

                <p><strong>Spelling Flames Considered Harmful.</strong> </p>

                <p>Every few months a plague descends on Usenet called the
                spelling flame. It starts out when someone posts an article
                correcting the spelling or grammar in some article. The immediate
                result seems to be for everyone on the net to turn into a 6th
                grade English teacher and pick apart each other's postings for a
                few weeks. This is not productive and tends to cause people who
                used to be friends to get angry with each other. </p>

                <p>It is important to remember that we all make mistakes, and
                that there are many users on the net who use English as a second
                language. There are also a number of people who suffer from
                dyslexia and who have difficulty noticing their spelling
                mistakes. If you feel that you must make a comment on the quality
                of a posting, please do so by mail, not on the network. </p>

                <p><strong>Don't Overdo Signatures.</strong> </p>

                <p>Signatures are nice, and many people can have a signature
                added to their postings automatically by placing it in a file
                called &quot;$HOME/.signature&quot;. Don't overdo it. Signatures
                can tell the world something about you, but keep them short. A
                signature that is longer than the message itself is considered to
                be in bad taste. The main purpose of a signature is to help
                people locate you, not to tell your life story. Every signature
                should include at least your return address relative to a major,
                known site on the network and a proper domain-format address.
                Your system administrator can give this to you. Some news posters
                attempt to enforce a 4 line limit on signature files -- an amount
                that should be more than sufficient to provide a return address
                and attribution. </p>

                <p><strong>Limit Line Length and Avoid Control Characters.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>Try to keep your text in a generic format. Many (if not most)
                of the people reading Usenet do so from 80 column terminals or
                from workstations with 80 column terminal windows. Try to keep
                your lines of text to less than 80 characters for optimal
                readability. If people quote part of your article in a followup,
                short lines will probably show up better, too. </p>

                <p>Also realize that there are many, many different forms of
                terminals in use. If you enter special control characters in your
                message, it may result in your message being unreadable on some
                terminal types; a character sequence that causes reverse video on
                your screen may result in a keyboard lock and graphics mode on
                someone else's terminal. You should also try to avoid the use of
                tabs, too, since they may also be interpreted differently on
                terminals other than your own. </p>

                <p><strong>Please do not use Usenet as a resource for homework
                assignments. </strong></p>

                <p>Usenet is not a resource for homework or class assignments. A
                common new user reaction to learning of all these people out
                there holding discussions is to view them as a great resource for
                gathering information for reports and papers. Trouble is, after
                seeing a few hundred such requests, most people get tired of
                them, and won't reply anyway. Certainly not in the expected or
                hoped-for numbers. Posting student questionnaires automatically
                brands you a &quot;newbie&quot; and does not usually garner much
                more than a tiny number of replies. Further, some of those
                replies are likely to be incorrect. </p>

                <p>Instead, read the group of interest for a while, and find out
                what the main &quot;threads&quot; are - what are people
                discussing? Are there any themes you can discover? Are there
                different schools of thought? Only post something after you've
                followed the group for a few weeks, after you have read the
                Frequently Asked Questions posting if the group has one, and if
                you still have a question or opinion that others will probably
                find interesting. If you have something interesting to
                contribute, you'll find that you gain almost instant acceptance,
                and your posting will generate a large number of follow-up
                postings. Use these in your research; it is a far more efficient
                (and accepted) way to learn about the group than to follow that
                first instinct and post a simple questionnaire. </p>

                <p><strong>Please do not use Usenet as an advertising medium.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>Advertisements on Usenet are rarely appreciated. In general,
                the louder or more inappropriate the ad is, the more antagonism
                it will stir up. The accompanying posting &quot;Rules for posting
                to Usenet&quot; has more on this in the section about
                &quot;Announcement of professional products or services&quot;.
                Try the biz.* hierarchies instead. </p>

                <p><strong>Avoid posting to multiple newsgroups.</strong> </p>

                <p>Few things annoy Usenet readers as much as multiple copies of
                a posting appearing in multiple newsgroups. (called 'spamming'
                for historical reasons) A posting that is cross-posted (i.e lists
                multiple newsgroups on the Newsgroups: header line) to a few
                appropriate newsgroups is fine, but even with cross-posts,
                restraint is advised. For a cross-post, you may want to set the
                Followup-To: header line to the most suitable group for the rest
                of the discussion. </p>
